We generated matched epigenome and transcriptome measurements in 86 primary cell types that span the mouse immune system and its differentiation cascades. This breadth of data enable variance components analysis that suggests that genes fall into two distinct classes, controlled by either enhancer- or promoter-driven logic, and multiple regression that connects genes to the enhancers that regulate them. Relating transcription factor (TF) expression to the genome-wide accessibility of their binding motifs classifies them as predominantly openers or closers of local chromatin accessibility, pinpointing specific <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements where binding of given TFs is likely functionally relevant, validated by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Overall, this <i>cis</i>-regulatory atlas provides a trove of information on transcriptional regulation through immune differentiation and a foundational scaffold to define key regulatory events throughout the immunological genome.</p>}},

  doi = {10.1101/2019.12.27.889691}, 
  abstract = {{AbstractThe computational prediction of gene function is a key step in making full use of newly sequenced genomes. Function is generally predicted by transferring annotations from homologous genes or proteins for which experimental evidence exists. The “ortholog conjecture” proposes that orthologous genes should be preferred when making such predictions, as they evolve functions more slowly than paralogous genes. Previous research has provided little support for the ortholog conjecture, though the incomplete nature of the data cast doubt on the conclusions. Here we use experimental annotations from over 40,000 proteins, drawn from over 80,000 publications, to revisit the ortholog conjecture in two pairs of species: (i) Homo sapiens and Mus musculus and (ii) Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. By making a distinction between questions about the evolution of function versus questions about the prediction of function, we find strong evidence against the ortholog conjecture in the context of function prediction, though questions about the evolution of function remain difficult to address. In both pairs of species, we quantify the amount of data that must be ignored if paralogs are discarded, as well as the resulting loss in prediction accuracy. Taken as a whole, our results support the view that the types of homologs used for function transfer are largely irrelevant to the task of function prediction. Aiming to maximize the amount of data used for this task, regardless of whether it comes from orthologs or paralogs, is most likely to lead to higher prediction accuracy.}},

  abstract = {{MOTIVATION:Cancer progression and development are initiated by aberrations in various molecular networks through coordinated changes across multiple genes and pathways. It is important to understand how these networks change under different stress conditions and/or patient-specific groups to infer differential patterns of activation and inhibition. Existing methods are limited to correlation networks that are independently estimated from separate group-specific data and without due consideration of relationships that are conserved across multiple groups.

METHOD:We propose a pathway-based differential network analysis in genomics (DINGO) model for estimating group-specific networks and making inference on the differential networks. DINGO jointly estimates the group-specific conditional dependencies by decomposing them into global and group-specific components. The delineation of these components allows for a more refined picture of the major driver and passenger events in the elucidation of cancer progression and development.

RESULTS:Simulation studies demonstrate that DINGO provides more accurate group-specific conditional dependencies than achieved by using separate estimation approaches. We apply DINGO to key signaling pathways in glioblastoma to build differential networks for long-term survivors and short-term survivors in The Cancer Genome Atlas. The hub genes found by mRNA expression, DNA copy number, methylation and microRNA expression reveal several important roles in glioblastoma progression.

But they rarely can locate that information because it is buried in the scientific literature, usually in a format that is inaccessible to text search engines. We have developed a public knowledgebase that enables data-driven access to the collection of peer-reviewed publications in molecular evolution and phylogenetics that have reported estimates of time of divergence between species. Users can query the TimeTree resource by providing two names of organisms (common or scientific) that can correspond to species or groups of species. The current TimeTree web resource (TimeTree2) contains timetrees reported from molecular clock analyses in 910 published studies and 17 341 species that span the diversity of life. TimeTree2 interprets complex and hierarchical data from these studies for each user query, which can be launched using an iPhone application, in addition to the website. Published time estimates are now readily accessible to the scientific community, K-12 and college educators, and the general public, without requiring knowledge of evolutionary nomenclature.

Their expression levels correlate with the activating potentials of the enhancers, but due to their instability, eRNAs have proven difficult to quantify in large scale. To overcome this, we use capped-nascent-RNA sequencing to efficiently capture the bidirectional initiation of eRNAs. We apply this in large scale to the human lymphoblastoid cell lines from the Yoruban population, and detected nearly 75,000 eRNA transcription sites with high sensitivity and specificity. We identify genetic variants significantly associated with overall eRNA initiation levels, as well as the transcription directionality between the two divergent eRNA pairs, namely the transcription initiation and directional initiation quantitative trait loci (tiQTLs and diQTLs) respectively. High-resolution analyses of these two types of eRNA QTLs reveal distinct positions of enrichment not only at the central transcription factor (TF) binding regions but also at the flanking eRNA initiation regions, both of which are equivalently associated with mRNA expression QTLs. These two regions - the central TF binding footprint and the eRNA initiation cores - define the bipartite architecture and the function of enhancers, and may provide further insights into interpreting the significance of non-coding regulatory variants.</p>}},

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides a unique opportunity to identify the functional impact of rare variants through combined analyses of whole genomes and multi-tissue RNA-sequencing data. Here, we identify gene expression outliers, or individuals with extreme expression levels, across 44 human tissues, and characterize the contribution of rare variation to these large changes in expression. We find 58\% of underexpression and 28\% of overexpression outliers have underlying rare variants compared with 9\% of non-outliers. Large expression effects are enriched for proximal loss-of-function, splicing, and structural variants, particularly variants near the TSS and at evolutionarily conserved sites. Known disease genes have expression outliers, underscoring that rare variants can contribute to genetic disease risk. To prioritize functional rare regulatory variants, we develop RIVER, a Bayesian approach that integrates RNA and whole genome sequencing data from the same individual. RIVER predicts functional variants significantly better than models using genomic annotations alone, and is an extensible tool for personal genome interpretation. Overall, we demonstrate that rare variants contribute to large gene expression changes across tissues with potential health consequences, and provide an integrative method for interpreting rare variants in individual genomes.}},

  abstract = {{Next-generation sequencing technology provides novel opportunities for gathering genome-scale sequence data in natural populations, laying the empirical foundation for the evolving field of population genomics. Here we conducted a genome scan of nucleotide diversity and differentiation in natural populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We used Illumina-sequenced RAD tags to identify and type over 45,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 100 individuals from two oceanic and three freshwater populations. Overall estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation among populations confirm the biogeographic hypothesis that large panmictic oceanic populations have repeatedly given rise to phenotypically divergent freshwater populations. Genomic regions exhibiting signatures of both balancing and divergent selection were remarkably consistent across multiple, independently derived populations, indicating that replicate parallel phenotypic evolution in stickleback may be occurring through extensive, parallel genetic evolution at a genome-wide scale. Some of these genomic regions co-localize with previously identified QTL for stickleback phenotypic variation identified using laboratory mapping crosses. In addition, we have identified several novel regions showing parallel differentiation across independent populations. Annotation of these regions revealed numerous genes that are candidates for stickleback phenotypic evolution and will form the basis of future genetic analyses in this and other organisms. This study represents the first high-density SNP-based genome scan of genetic diversity and differentiation for populations of threespine stickleback in the wild. These data illustrate the complementary nature of laboratory crosses and population genomic scans by confirming the adaptive significance of previously identified genomic regions, elucidating the particular evolutionary and demographic history of such regions in natural populations, and identifying new genomic regions and candidate genes of evolutionary significance.}},

Our locus-wide dissections of the cis-regulatory landscapes of fly patched and mouse Ptch1 reveal abundant, diverse enhancers with stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns. The seemingly simple, constitutive Hedgehog response of patched/Ptch1 is driven by a complex regulatory architecture, with batteries of context-specific enhancers engaged in promoter-specific interactions to tune signaling individually in each tissue, without disturbing patterning elsewhere. This structure—one of the oldest cis-regulatory features discovered in animal genomes—explains how patched/Ptch1 can drive dramatic adaptations in animal morphology while maintaining its essential core function.

These two classes of regulatory change differ in their relative contributions to expression differences in natural populations because of the combined effects of mutation and natural selection. Here, we investigate how new mutations create the regulatory variation upon which natural selection acts by quantifying the frequencies and effects of hundreds of new cis- and trans-acting mutations altering activity of the TDH3 promoter in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the absence of natural selection. We find that cis-regulatory mutations have larger effects on expression than trans-regulatory mutations and that while trans-regulatory mutations are more common overall, cis- and trans-regulatory changes in expression are equally abundant when only the largest changes in expression are considered. In addition, we find that cis-regulatory mutations are skewed toward decreased expression while trans-regulatory mutations are skewed toward increased expression. We also measure the effects of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations on the variability in gene expression among genetically identical cells, a property of gene expression known as expression noise, finding that trans-regulatory mutations are much more likely to decrease expression noise than cis-regulatory mutations. Because new mutations are the raw material upon which natural selection acts, these differences in the frequencies and effects of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations should be considered in models of regulatory evolution.}},

To elucidate the structural characteristics of newly arisen gene duplicates at infancy and their subsequent evolutionary properties, we analyzed gene pairs with ≤10\% divergence at synonymous sites within the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans . Structural heterogeneity between duplicate copies is present very early in their evolutionary history and is maintained over longer evolutionary timescales, suggesting that duplications across gene boundaries in conjunction with shuffling events have at least as much potential to contribute to long-term evolution as do fully redundant (complete) duplicates. The median duplication span of 1.4 kb falls short of the average gene length in C. elegans (2.5 kb), suggesting that partial gene duplications are frequent. Most gene duplicates reside close to the parent copy at inception, often as tandem inverted loci, and appear to disperse in the genome as they age, as a result of reduced survivorship of duplicates located in proximity to the ancestral copy. We propose that illegitimate recombination events leading to inverted duplications play a disproportionately large role in gene duplication within this genome in comparison with other mechanisms.}},

Moreover, the activity of these 5' enhancers in embryonic neuroretina cells is weaker at day 5 than at day 7, like the EP enhancer, and parallels the level of expression of P0-initiated mRNAs. Footprinting experiments show that neuroretina-specific factors bind to these 5' enhancer elements. In addition we show that these quail Pax-6 enhancer elements, as well as the P0 promoter, are structurally and functionally conserved in humans. These results strongly suggest that these enhancer elements may contribute to the neuroretina-specific transcriptional regulation of the Pax-6 gene in vivo. Thus the complex regulation of the quail Pax-6 gene is also conserved in humans.}},

Although all nine coefficients can be estimated from pedigrees, six coefficients have been beyond empirical reach. We provide a numerical optimization procedure that estimates all seven reduced coefficients from population-genomic data. Simulations show that the procedure is nearly unbiased, even at 3× coverage, and errors in five of the seven coefficients are statistically uncorrelated. The remaining two coefficients have a negative correlation of errors, but their sum provides an unbiased assessment of the overall correlation of heterozygosity between two individuals. Application of these new methods to four populations of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia pulex reveal the occurrence of half siblings in our samples, as well as a number of identical individuals that are likely obligately asexual clone mates. Statistically significant negative estimates of these pairwise relatedness coefficients, including inbreeding coefficients that were typically negative, underscore the difficulties that arise when interpreting genotypic correlations as estimations of the probability that alleles are identical by descent.}},

We find that (1) tandem gene duplication has generated ∼80\% of the nascent duplicates that are limited to single species (D. melanogaster or Drosophila yakuba); (2) the most abundant new genes shared by multiple species (44.1\%) are dispersed duplicates, and are more likely to be retained and be functional; (3) de novo gene origination from noncoding sequences plays an unexpectedly important role during the origin of new genes, and is responsible for 11.9\% of the new genes; (4) retroposition is also an important mechanism, and had generated ∼10\% of the new genes; (5) ∼30\% of the new genes in the D. melanogaster species complex recruited various genomic sequences and formed chimeric gene structures, suggesting structure innovation as an important way to help fixation of new genes; and (6) the rate of the origin of new functional genes is estimated to be five to 11 genes per million years in the D. melanogaster subgroup. Finally, we survey gene frequencies among 19 globally derived strains for D. melanogaster-specific new genes and reveal that 44.4\% of them show copy number polymorphisms within a population.

Here we have assessed the transcriptional response to light in the photosynthetic species Symbiodinium kawagutii. We find that three genes previously reported to respond to light using qPCR do not show differential expression using northern blots or RNA-Seq. Interestingly, global transcript profiling by RNA-Seq at LD 0 (dawn) and LD 12 (dusk) found only seven light-regulated genes (FDR = 0.1). qPCR using three randomly selected genes out of the seven was only able to validate differential expression of two.

We addressed these issues by developing an unsupervised machine learning approach termed clustering of genomic regions analysis method (CREAM). CREAM automates CORE detection from chromatin accessibility profiles that are enriched in CREs strongly bound by master transcription regulators, proximal to highly expressed and essential genes, and discriminating cell identity. Although COREs share similarities with super-enhancers, we highlight differences in terms of the genomic distribution and structure of these cis-regulatory units. We further show the enhanced value of COREs over super-enhancers to identify master transcription regulators, highly expressed and essential genes defining cell identity. COREs enrich at topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries. They are also preferentially bound by the chromatin looping factors CTCF and cohesin, in contrast to super-enhancers, forming clusters of CTCF and cohesin binding regions and defining homotypic clusters of transcription regulator binding regions (HCTs). Finally, we show the clinical utility of CREAM to identify COREs across chromatin accessibility profiles to stratify more than 400 tumor samples according to their cancer type and to delineate cancer type-specific active biological pathways. Collectively, our results support the utility of CREAM to delineate COREs underlying, with greater accuracy than individual CREs or super-enhancers, the cell-type-specific biological underpinning across a wide range of normal and cancer cell types.}},

  abstract = {{Representatives of the Insecta and the Malacostraca (higher crustaceans) have highly derived body plans subdivided into several tagma, groups of segments united by a common function and/or morphology. The tagmatization of segments in the trunk, the part of the body between head and telson, in both lineages is thought to have evolved independently from ancestors with a distinct head but a homonomous, undifferentiated trunk. In the branchiopod crustacean, Artemia franciscana, the trunk Hox genes are expressed in broad overlapping domains suggesting a conserved ancestral state (Averof, M. and Akam, M. (1995) Nature 376, 420-423). In comparison, in insects, the Antennapedia-class genes of the homeotic clusters are more regionally deployed into distinct domains where they serve to control the morphology of the different trunk segments. Thus an originally Artemia-like pattern of homeotic gene expression has apparently been modified in the insect lineage associated with and perhaps facilitating the observed pattern of tagmatization. Since insects are the only arthropods with a derived trunk tagmosis tested to date, we examined the expression patterns of the Hox genes Antp, Ubx and abd-A in the malacostracan crustacean Porcellio scaber (Oniscidae, Isopoda). We found that, unlike the pattern seen in Artemia, these genes are expressed in well-defined discrete domains coinciding with tagmatic boundaries which are distinct from those of the insects. Our observations suggest that, during the independent tagmatization in insects and malacostracan crustaceans, the homologous 'trunk' genes evolved to perform different developmental functions. We also propose that, in each lineage, the changes in Hox gene expression pattern may have been important in trunk tagmatization.}},

Studies have shown that active enhancers can be transcribed into enhancer RNA (eRNA). Here, we identify actively transcribed regulatory elements in human pancreatic islets by generating eRNA profiles using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) across 70 islet samples. We identify 9,954 clusters of CAGE tag transcription start sites (TSS) or tag clusters (TCs) in islets, \textbackslashtextasciitilde20\% of which are islet-specific when compared to CAGE TCs across publicly available tissues. Islet TCs are most enriched to overlap genome wide association study (GWAS) loci for islet-relevant traits such as fasting glucose. We integrated islet CAGE profiles with diverse epigenomic information such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) profiles of five histone modifications and accessible chromatin profiles from the assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq), to understand how the underlying islet chromatin landscape is associated with TSSs. We identify that ATAC-seq informed transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TF 9footprint9 motifs) for the RFX TF family are highly enriched in transcribed regions occurring in enhancer chromatin states, whereas TF footprint motifs for the ETS family are highly enriched in transcribed regions within promoter chromatin states. Using massively parallel reporter assays in a rat pancreatic islet beta cell line, we tested the activity of 3,378 islet CAGE elements and found that 2,279 (\textbackslashtextasciitilde67.5\%) show significant regulatory activity (5\% FDR). We find that TCs within accessible enhancer show higher enrichment to overlap T2D GWAS loci than accessible enhancer annotations alone, suggesting that TC annotations pinpoint active regions within the enhancer chromatin states.

Previous studies have explored the presence of genomic features, such as CpG islands and sequence motifs, in these promoter classes, but virtually no studies have directly investigated the relationship with chromatin features. Here, we show that promoter classes are significantly differentiated by nucleosome organization and chromatin structure. Dispersed promoters display higher associations with well-positioned nucleosomes downstream of the TSS and a more clearly defined nucleosome free region upstream, while focused promoters have a less organized nucleosome structure, yet higher presence of RNA polymerase II. These differences extend to histone variants (H2A.Z) and marks (H3K4 methylation), as well as insulator binding (such as CTCF), independent of the expression levels of affected genes. Notably, differences are conserved across mammals and flies, and they provide for a clearer separation of promoter architectures than the presence and absence of CpG islands or the occurrence of stalled RNA polymerase. Computational models support the stronger contribution of chromatin features to the definition of dispersed promoters compared to focused start sites. Our results show that promoter classes defined from 5' capped transcripts not only reflect differences in the initiation process at the core promoter but also are indicative of divergent transcriptional programs established within gene-proximal nucleosome organization.}},

We hypothesize that the mutational dynamics of the mitochondrial genome would have favored the evolution of sexual reproduction. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exhibits a high-mutation rate across most eukaryote taxa, and several lines of evidence suggest that this high rate is an ancestral character. This seems inexplicable given that mtDNA-encoded genes underlie the expression of life's most salient functions, including energy conversion. We propose that negative metabolic effects linked to mitochondrial mutation accumulation would have invoked selection for sexual recombination between divergent host nuclear genomes in early eukaryote lineages. This would provide a mechanism by which recombinant host genotypes could be rapidly shuffled and screened for the presence of compensatory modifiers that offset mtDNA-induced harm. Under this hypothesis, recombination provides the genetic variation necessary for compensatory nuclear coadaptation to keep pace with mitochondrial mutation accumulation.}},

This dynamic genomic organization permits some single DNA segments in the germline to contribute to multiple, distinct somatic genes via alternative processing. Like alternative mRNA splicing, the combinatorial assembly of DNA segments contributes to genetic variation and facilitates the evolution of new genes. In this study, we use comparative genomic analysis to demonstrate that the emergence of alternative DNA splicing is associated with the origin of new genes. Short duplications give rise to alternative gene segments that are spliced to the shared gene segments. Alternative gene segments evolve faster than shared, constitutive segments. Genes with shared segments frequently have different expression profiles, permitting functional divergence. This study reports alternative DNA splicing as a mechanism of new gene origination, illustrating how the process of programmed genome rearrangement gives rise to evolutionary innovation.}},

Further, we find that genes with high cell-to-cell variability in transcript numbers generally have lower genomic copy numbers, and vice versa, suggesting that copy number variations may drive variability in gene expression among individual cells.

We used two publicly available datasets, the GTEX cis-eQTL database (v7) and a catalog of high-frequency Homo sapiens specific alleles relative to the Neanderthals and Denisovan sequences, to understand how high-frequency Homo Sapiens derived alleles affect gene expression regulation. The resulting dataset shows that genes associated with brain development are affected by Homo sapiens-specific eQTL in brain areas key in human evolution such as the cerebellum. We also show that some of these eQTL overlap significantly with putative regions of positive selection relative to archaic humans [Peyregne et al., 2017]. Additionally, we tested whether any of the variants are associated with clinical conditions in modern human populations.

Interactome maps connecting disease-risk variants in cell type-specific enhancers to promoters revealed an extended microglia gene network in AD. Deletion of a microglia-specific enhancer harboring AD-risk variants ablated <i>BIN1</i> expression in microglia but not in neurons or astrocytes. These findings revise and expand the genes likely to be influenced by non-coding variants in AD and suggest the probable cell types in which they function.</p>}},

  abstract = {{Housekeeping genes of animal genomes cluster in the same chromosomal regions. It has long been suggested that this organization contributes to their steady expression across all the tissues of the organism. Here we show that the activity of Drosophila housekeeping gene promoters depends on the expression of their neighbours. By measuring the expression of \textbackslashtextasciitilde 85,000 reporters integrated in Kc167 cells, we identified the best predictors of expression as chromosomal contacts with the promoters and terminators of active genes. Surprisingly, the chromatin composition at the insertion site and the contacts with enhancers were less informative. These results are substantiated by the existence of genomic 'paradoxical' domains, rich in euchromatic features and enhancers, but where the reporters are expressed at low level, concomitant with a deficit of interactions with promoters and terminators. This indicates that the proper function of housekeeping genes relies not on contacts with long distance enhancers but on spatial clustering. Overall our results suggest that spatial proximity between genes increases their expression and that the linear architecture of the Drosophila genome contributes to this effect.}},

We conducted genetic screens to identify the negative regulators of <i>HO</i> expression necessary to limit <i>HO</i> transcription. Known repressors of <i>HO</i> (Ash1 and Rpd3) were identified, as well as several additional chromatin-associated factors including the Hda1 histone deacetylase, the Isw2 chromatin remodeler, and the corepressor Tup1. We also identified clusters of <i>HO</i> promoter mutations that suggested roles for the Dot6/Tod6 (PAC site) and Ume6 repression pathways. We used ChIP assays with synchronized cells to validate the involvement of these factors and map the association of Ash1, Dot6, and Ume6 with the <i>HO</i> promoter to a brief window in the cell cycle between binding of the initial activating transcription factor and initiation of transcription. We found that Ash1 and Ume6 each recruit the Rpd3 histone deacetylase to <i>HO</i>, and their effects are additive. In contrast, Rpd3 was not recruited significantly to the PAC site, suggesting this site has a distinct mechanism for repression. Increases in <i>HO</i> expression and SWI/SNF recruitment were all additive upon loss of Ash1, Ume6, and PAC site factors, indicating the convergence of independent pathways for repression. Our results demonstrate that multiple protein complexes are important for limiting the spread of SWI/SNF mediated nucleosome eviction across the <i>HO</i> promoter, suggesting that regulation requires a delicate balance of activities that promote and repress transcription.</p>}},

Nonetheless, single-nucleotide variations have the largest effect when occurring on 3'UTR motifs or upstream AUGs. Analyzing mRNA half-life data of 34 knockout strains showed that the effect of codon usage not only requires functional decapping and deadenylation, but also the 5'-to-3' exonuclease Xrn1, the non-sense mediated decay genes, but not no-go decay. Altogether, this study quantitatively delineates the contributions of mRNA sequence features on stability in yeast, reveals their functional dependencies on degradation pathways, and allows accurate prediction of half-life from mRNA sequence.}},

For the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, we applied gene expression trajectory models to identify the genes involved in driving cell fate transitions. We modified trajectory models to account for the scenario where cells were exposed to different stimuli, in this case epidermal growth factor and heregulin, to arrive at different cell fates, i.e. proliferation and differentiation respectively. Using genome-wide CAGE time series data collected from the FANTOM5 consortium, we identified the sets of promoters that were involved in the transition of MCF-7 cells to their specific fates versus those with expression changes that were generic to both stimuli. Of the 1,552 promoters identified, 1,091 had stimulus-specific expression while 461 promoters had generic expression profiles over the time course surveyed. Many of these stimulus-specific promoters mapped to key regulators of the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) signaling pathway such as FHL2 (four and a half LIM domains 2). We observed that in general, generic promoters peaked in their expression early on in the time course, while stimulus-specific promoters tended to show activation of their expression at a later stage. The genes that mapped to stimulus-specific promoters were enriched for pathways that control focal adhesion, p53 signaling and MAPK signaling while generic promoters were enriched for cell death, transcription and the cell cycle. We identified 162 genes that were controlled by an alternative promoter during the time course where a subset of 37 genes had separate promoters that were classified as stimulus-specific and generic. The results of our study highlighted the degree of complexity involved in regulating a cell fate transition where multiple promoters mapping to the same gene can demonstrate quite divergent expression profiles.}},

  abstract = {{Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation is dependent on metabolic state, and implicates specific metabolic factors in neural functions that drive behaviour1. In neurons, acetylation of histones relies on the metabolite acetyl-CoA, which is produced from acetate by chromatin-bound acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2)2. Notably, the breakdown of alcohol in the liver leads to a rapid increase in levels of blood acetate3, and alcohol is therefore a major source of acetate in the body. Histone acetylation in neurons may thus be under the influence of acetate that is derived from alcohol4, with potential effects on alcohol-induced gene expression in the brain, and on behaviour5. Here, using in vivo stable-isotope labelling in mice, we show that the metabolism of alcohol contributes to rapid acetylation of histones in the brain, and that this occurs in part through the direct deposition of acetyl groups that are derived from alcohol onto histones in an ACSS2-dependent manner. A similar direct deposition was observed when mice were injected with heavy-labelled acetate in vivo. In a pregnant mouse, exposure to labelled alcohol resulted in the incorporation of labelled acetyl groups into gestating fetal brains. In isolated primary hippocampal neurons ex vivo, extracellular acetate induced transcriptional programs related to learning and memory, which were sensitive to ACSS2 inhibition. We show that alcohol-related associative learning requires ACSS2 in vivo. These findings suggest that there is a direct link between alcohol metabolism and gene regulation, through the ACSS2-dependent acetylation of histones in the brain. Acetate that is produced from the breakdown of alcohol contributes to histone acetylation in the brain, indicating that there is a direct link between alcohol metabolism and gene expression.}},

Whereas ribosome-profiling suggested that MTOR almost exclusively stimulates translation of the TOP (terminal oligopyrimidine motif) and TOP-like mRNAs, polysome-profiling indicated that MTOR also modulates translation of mRNAs without the 5' TOP motif (non-TOP mRNAs). We demonstrate that in ribosome-profiling studies, detection of MTOR-dependent changes in non-TOP mRNA translation was obscured by low sensitivity and methodology biases. Transcription start site profiling using nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE) revealed that not only do many MTOR-sensitive mRNAs lack the 5' TOP motif but that 5' UTR features distinguish two functionally and translationally distinct subsets of MTOR-sensitive mRNAs: (1) mRNAs with short 5' UTRs enriched for mitochondrial functions, which require EIF4E but are less EIF4A1-sensitive; and (2) long 5' UTR mRNAs encoding proliferation- and survival-promoting proteins, which are both EIF4E- and EIF4A1-sensitive. Selective inhibition of translation of mRNAs harboring long 5' UTRs via EIF4A1 suppression leads to sustained expression of proteins involved in respiration but concomitant loss of those protecting mitochondrial structural integrity, resulting in apoptosis. Conversely, simultaneous suppression of translation of both long and short 5' UTR mRNAs by MTOR inhibitors results in metabolic dormancy and a predominantly cytostatic effect. Thus, 5' UTR features define different modes of MTOR-sensitive translation of functionally distinct subsets of mRNAs, which may explain the diverse impact of MTOR and EIF4A inhibitors on neoplastic cells.}},

Core elements (e.g. INR and TATA box) are located within \textbackslashtextasciitilde50bp of the transcription start site and both upstream and downstream elements are known. Although all can affect the level of gene expression, their mechanism of action has yet to be fully defined. The studies described here are focused on two core promoter elements, INR and BRE, in the human genome. The locations of the two elements were determined in a large number of human promoters and the results were interpreted in terms of overall promoter function. Results A total of 13,406 promoters were collected from the reference version of the human genome and found to contain 62,891 INR sequences and 32,290 BRE. An INR sequence was found in the core region of 1231 (9.2\%) promoters and a BRE in 2592 (19.3\%); 121 promoters (0.9\%) have both INR and BRE elements. Counts support the view that most human promoters lack an INR or BRE element in the core promoter. Further analysis was carried out with the aligned aggregate of promoters from each chromosome. The results showed distinct INR distributions in separate chromosome groups indicating a degree of chromosome specificity to the way core promoter elements are deployed in the genome. The rare promoters with both INR and BRE elements were found to be enriched among the genes with divergent transcription. Enrichment raises the possibility that core promoter elements can have a function in chromosome organization as well as in initiation of transcription.}},

Using this framework, we systematically investigate the effect of promoter architecture, that is, the number, quality and position of transcription factor binding sites, on cell-to-cell variability in transcription levels. We compare architectures resulting in transcriptional activation with those resulting in transcriptional repression. We start from simple activation and repression motifs with a single operator sequence, and explore the parameter regime for which the cell-to-cell variability is maximal. Using the same formalism, we then turn to more complicated architectures with more than one operator. We examine the effect of independent and cooperative binding, as well as the role of DNA mechanics for those architectures where DNA looping is relevant. We examine the interplay between operator strength and operator number, and we make specific predictions for single-cell mRNA-counting experiments with well characterized promoters. This theoretical approach makes it possible to find the statistical response of a population of cells to perturbations in the architecture of the promoter; it can be used to quantitatively test physical models of gene regulation in vivo, and as the basis of a more systematic approach to designing new promoter architectures.}},

However, there has been considerable debate surrounding the reliability of these inferences2–5 and, to date, this critical question remains unresolved. Here we clarify the precise information that can be extracted from extant timetrees under the generalized birth–death model, which underlies most existing methods of estimation. We prove that, for any diversification scenario, there exists an infinite number of alternative diversification scenarios that are equally likely to have generated any given extant timetree. These ‘congruent’ scenarios cannot possibly be distinguished using extant timetrees alone, even in the presence of infinite data. Importantly, congruent diversification scenarios can exhibit markedly different and yet similarly plausible dynamics, which suggests that many previous studies may have over-interpreted phylogenetic evidence. We introduce identifiable and easily interpretable variables that contain all available information about past diversification dynamics, and demonstrate that these can be estimated from extant timetrees. We suggest that measuring and modelling these identifiable variables offers a more robust way to study historical diversification dynamics. Our findings also make it clear that palaeontological data will continue to be crucial for answering some macroevolutionary questions. An infinite number of alternative diversification scenarios—which may have markedly different, but equally plausible, dynamics—can underpin a given time-calibrated phylogeny of extant species, suggesting many previous studies have over-interpreted phylogenetic evidence.}},

To facilitate data extraction, SEA supports multiple search options, including species, genome location, gene name, cell type/tissue and super-enhancer name. The response provides detailed (epi)genetic information, incorporating cell type specificity, nearby genes, transcriptional factor binding sites, CRISPR/Cas9 target sites, evolutionary conservation, SNPs, H3K27ac, DNA methylation, gene expression and TF ChIP-seq data.

Here, we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits are partitioned into direct effects from core genes and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting in <i>trans</i>. We propose that most heritability is driven by weak <i>trans</i>-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak <i>trans</i> effects.

This growing commitment to open science should be applauded and encouraged, especially when it occurs voluntarily and prior to peer review. Thanks to other researchers9 dedication to open science, we have had the privilege of conducting a reanalysis of a landmark experiment published as a preprint with data made available in a public repository. The study in question found that promoter DNA methylation is frequently insufficient to induce transcriptional repression, which appears to contradict a large body of observational studies showing a strong association between DNA methylation and gene expression. This study was the first to evaluate whether forcibly methylating thousands of DNA promoter regions is sufficient to suppress gene expression. The authors9 data analysis did not find a strong relationship between promoter methylation and transcriptional repression. However, their analyses did not make full use of statistical inference and applied a normalization technique that removes global differences that are representative of the actual biological system. Here we reanalyze the data with an approach that includes statistical inference of differentially methylated regions, as well as a normalization technique that accounts for global expression differences. We find that forced DNA methylation of thousands of promoters overwhelmingly represses gene expression. In addition, we show that complementary epigenetic marks of active transcription are reduced as a result of DNA methylation. Finally, by studying whether these associations are sensitive to the CG density of promoters, we find no substantial differences in the association between promoters with and without a CG island.

In the past few decades, studies in animals have provided a number of examples in which phenotypic changes can be traced back to specific alterations in transcriptional regulation. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and functional genomics have stimulated a new wave of investigation in simple model organisms. In particular, several genome-wide comparative analyses of transcriptional circuits across different yeast species have been performed. These studies have revealed that transcription networks are remarkably plastic: large scale rewiring in which target genes move in and out of regulons through changes in cis-regulatory sequences appears to be a general phenomenon. Transcription factor substitution and the formation of new combinatorial interactions are also important contributors to the rewiring. In several cases, a transition through intermediates with redundant regulatory programs has been suggested as a mechanism through which rewiring can occur without a loss in fitness. Because the basic features of transcriptional regulation are deeply conserved, we speculate that large scale rewiring may underlie the evolution of complex phenotypes in multi-cellular organisms; if so, such rewiring may leave traceable changes in the genome from which the genetic basis of functional innovation can be detected.}},

The mechanistic consequences of linear gene order, and how it may relate to the functional output of genome organization, remain to be fully resolved, however. Here we tested the relationship between linear and 3D organization of gene regulation during myogenesis. Our analysis has identified a subset of topologically associated domains (TADs) that are significantly enriched for muscle-specific genes. These lineage-enriched TADs demonstrate an expression-dependent pattern of nuclear organization that influences the positioning of adjacent nonenriched TADs. Therefore, lineage-enriched TADs inform cell-specific genome organization during myogenesis. The reduction of allelic spatial distance of one of these domains, which contains Myogenin, correlates with reduced transcriptional variability, identifying a potential role for lineage-specific nuclear topology. Using a fusion-based strategy to decouple mitosis and myotube formation, we demonstrate that the cell-specific topology of syncytial nuclei is dependent on cell division. We propose that the effects of linear and spatial organization of gene loci on gene regulation are linked through TAD architecture, and that mitosis is critical for establishing nuclear topologies during cellular differentiation.}},

Eleanors are clusters of ncRNAs that accumulate around the estrogen receptor-α (ESR1) gene locus in long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED) breast cancer cells, and markedly enhance the transcription of the ESR1 gene. Here we detected nucleosome depletion around the transcription site of Eleanor2, the most highly expressed Eleanor in the LTED cells. We found that the purified Eleanor2 RNA fragment drastically destabilized the nucleosome in vitro. This activity was also exerted by other ncRNAs, but not by poly(U) RNA or DNA. The RNA-mediated nucleosome destabilization may be a common feature among natural nuclear RNAs, and may function in transcription regulation in chromatin. The Eleanor cluster of non-coding RNAs is localised upstream of estrogen receptor-α (ESR1) gene locus in estrogen-deprived breast cancer cells. Fujita et al find that RNA fragments of Eleanor2 and of other non-coding RNAs are able to destabilise nucleosomes in vitro, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation.}},

Previous work established mRNA-derived gene duplicates, known as retrocopies, as models for the study of new gene origination. Here we combine mammalian transcriptomic and epigenomic data to unveil the processes underlying the evolution of stripped-down retrocopies into complex new genes. We show that although some robustly expressed retrocopies are transcribed from preexisting promoters, most evolved new promoters from scratch or recruited proto-promoters in their genomic vicinity. In particular, many retrocopy promoters emerged from ancestral enhancers (or bivalent regulatory elements) or are located in CpG islands not associated with other genes. We detected 88-280 selectively preserved retrocopies per mammalian species, illustrating that these mechanisms facilitated the birth of many functional retrogenes during mammalian evolution. The regulatory evolution of originally monoexonic retrocopies was frequently accompanied by exon gain, which facilitated co-option of distant promoters and allowed expression of alternative isoforms. While young retrogenes are often initially expressed in the testis, increased regulatory and structural complexities allowed retrogenes to functionally diversify and evolve somatic organ functions, sometimes as complex as those of their parents. Thus, some retrogenes evolved the capacity to temporarily substitute for their parents during the process of male meiotic X inactivation, while others rendered parental functions superfluous, allowing for parental gene loss. Overall, our reconstruction of the "life history" of mammalian retrogenes highlights retroposition as a general model for understanding new gene birth and functional evolution.}},

Here, we apply permanganate treatment and chromatin immunoprecipitation (PIP-seq) of initiation factors to identify the precise location of melted DNA separately associated with the preinitiation complex (PIC) and the adjacent paused complex (PC). This approach revealed the two known modes of transcription initiation. However, in contrast to prevailing views, they co-occurred within the same promoter region: initiation originating from a focused PIC, and broad nucleosome-linked initiation. PIP-seq allowed transcriptional orientation of Pol II to be determined, which may be useful near promoters where sufficient sense/anti-sense transcript mapping information is lacking. PIP-seq detected divergently oriented Pol II at both coding and noncoding promoters, as well as at enhancers. Their occupancy levels were not necessarily coupled in the two orientations. DNA sequence and shape analysis of initiation complex sites suggest that both sequence and shape contribute to specificity, but in a context-restricted manner. That is, initiation sites have the locally "best" initiator (INR) sequence and/or shape. These findings reveal a common core to pervasive Pol II initiation throughout the human genome.}},

However, most young duplicates are degraded by loss-of-function mutations, and the factors that allow some duplicate pairs to survive long-term remain controversial. One class of models to explain duplicate retention invokes sub- or neofunctionalization, whereas others focus on sharing of gene dosage. RNA-sequencing data from 46 human and 26 mouse tissues indicate that subfunctionalization of expression evolves slowly and is rare among duplicates that arose within the placental mammals, possibly because tandem duplicates are coregulated by shared genomic elements. Instead, consistent with the dosage-sharing hypothesis, most young duplicates are down-regulated to match expression levels of single-copy genes. Thus, dosage sharing of expression allows for the initial survival of mammalian duplicates, followed by slower functional adaptation enabling long-term preservation.}},

We found that 58\% of rare variants in the protein-coding exome of the general population are located in only 2\% of the genes. Prompted by this observation, we aimed to develop a gene-level approach for predicting whether a given human protein-coding gene is likely to harbor disease-causing mutations. To this end, we derived the gene damage index (GDI): a genome-wide, gene-level metric of the mutational damage that has accumulated in the general population. We found that the GDI was correlated with selective evolutionary pressure, protein complexity, coding sequence length, and the number of paralogs. We compared GDI with the leading gene-level approaches, genic intolerance, and de novo excess, and demonstrated that GDI performed best for the detection of false positives (i.e., removing exome variants in genes irrelevant to disease), whereas genic intolerance and de novo excess performed better for the detection of true positives (i.e., assessing de novo mutations in genes likely to be disease causing).

However, application of TSS profiling to date has largely been restricted to a small set of prominent model systems. We sought to characterize the cis -regulatory landscape of the water flea Daphnia pulex, an emerging model arthropod that reproduces both asexually ( via parthenogenesis) and sexually ( via meiosis). We performed CAGE with RNA isolated from D. pulex within three developmental states: sexual females, asexual females, and males. Identified TSSs were utilized to generate a ‘Daphnia Promoter Atlas’-a catalog of active promoters across the surveyed states. We carried out de novo motif discovery using CAGE-defined TSSs and identified eight candidate core promoter motifs; this collection includes canonical promoter elements ( e.g . TATA, Initiator) in addition to others lacking obvious orthologs. A comparison of promoter activities found evidence for considerable state-specific differential gene expression between states. Our work represents the first global definition of transcription initiation and promoter architecture in crustaceans. The Daphnia Promoter Atlas presented here provides a valuable resource for comparative study of cis -regulatory regions in arthropods, as well as for investigations into the circuitries that underpin meiosis and parthenogenesis.}},

Here, we identify the genetic differences between species in the genus Clarkia that are responsible for evolutionary change in an ecologically important element of floral colour patterns: spot position. The evolutionary shift in spot position was due to two simple genetic changes that resulted in the appearance of a transcription factor binding site mutation in the R2R3 Myb gene that changes spot formation. These genetic changes caused R2R3 Myb to be activated by a different transcription factor that is expressed in a different position in the petal. These results suggest that the regulatory rewiring paradigm is as applicable to plants as it is to animals, and support the hypothesis that cis-regulatory changes may often play a role in plant morphological evolution.}},

In the present study, we demonstrate that two responses to environmental stress signaling in the crustacean Daphnia magna--hemoglobin accumulation and male offspring production--are co-elevated by the crustacean terpenoid hormone methyl farnesoate and several synthetic analogs. Potency of the hormones with respect to the induction of both hemoglobin and male offspring was highly correlated, suggesting that both processes are regulated by the same terpenoid signaling pathway. Six clones of the D. pulex/pulicaria species complex that were previously characterized as unable to produce male offspring and five clones that were capable of producing males were evaluated for both hemoglobin induction and male offspring production in response to methyl farnesoate. Four of the five male-producing clones produced both hemoglobin and male offspring in response to the hormone. Five of the six non-male-producing clones produced neither hemoglobin nor males in response to the hormone. These results provide additional evidence that both physiological processes are regulated by the same signaling pathway. Furthermore, the results indicate that the non-male-producing clones are largely defective in some methyl farnesoate signaling component, downstream from methyl farnesoate synthesis but upstream from the genes regulated by the hormone. A likely candidate for the site of the defect is the methyl farnesoate receptor. As a consequence of this defect, non-male-producing clones have lost their responsiveness to environmental signals that are transduced by this endocrine pathway. This defect in signaling would be likely to enhance population growth in stable environments due to the elimination of males from the population, assuming that other processes critical to population growth are not also compromised by this defect.}},

Here, we explore the utility of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) as a complementary diagnostic tool in a cohort of 50 patients with genetically undiagnosed rare neuromuscular disorders. We describe an integrated approach to analyze patient muscle RNA-seq, leveraging an analysis framework focused on the detection of transcript-level changes that are unique to the patient compared to over 180 control skeletal muscle samples. We demonstrate the power of RNA-seq to validate candidate splice-disrupting mutations and to identify splice-altering variants in both exonic and deep intronic regions, yielding an overall diagnosis rate of 35\%. We also report the discovery of a highly recurrent de novo intronic mutation in COL6A1 that results in a dominantly acting splice-gain event, disrupting the critical glycine repeat motif of the triple helical domain. We identify this pathogenic variant in a total of 27 genetically unsolved patients in an external collagen VI-like dystrophy cohort, thus explaining approximately 25\% of patients clinically suggestive of collagen VI dystrophy in whom prior genetic analysis is negative. Overall, this study represents the largest systematic application of transcriptome sequencing to rare disease diagnosis to date and highlights its utility for the detection and interpretation of variants missed by current standard diagnostic approaches.}},

As gene regulation requires interactions between loci, negative epistatic interactions between divergent regulatory elements might underlie hybrid incompatibilities and contribute to reproductive isolation. Here, we take advantage of a cross between house mouse subspecies, where hybrid dysfunction is largely unidirectional, to test several key predictions about regulatory divergence and reproductive isolation. Regulatory divergence between Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus was characterized by studying allele-specific expression in fertile hybrid males using mRNA-sequencing of whole testes. We found extensive regulatory divergence between M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus, largely attributable to cis-regulatory changes. When both cis and trans changes occurred, they were observed in opposition much more often than expected under a neutral model, providing strong evidence of widespread compensatory evolution. We also found evidence for lineage-specific positive selection on a subset of genes related to transcriptional regulation. Comparisons of fertile and sterile hybrid males identified a set of genes that were uniquely misexpressed in sterile individuals. Lastly, we discovered a nonrandom association between these genes and genes showing evidence of compensatory evolution, consistent with the idea that regulatory interactions might contribute to Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities and be important in speciation.}},

The molecular determinants of these selective transcriptional responses remain elusive. Here, we present an integrated time-course analysis of transcription and mRNA dynamics following MYC activation in proliferating mouse fibroblasts, based on chromatin immunoprecipitation, metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNA, extensive sequencing, and mathematical modeling. Transcriptional activation correlated with the highest increases in MYC binding at promoters. Repression followed a reciprocal scenario, with the lowest gains in MYC binding. Altogether, the relative abundance (henceforth, "share") of MYC at promoters was the strongest predictor of transcriptional responses in diverse cell types, predominating over MYC's association with the corepressor ZBTB17 (also known as MIZ1). MYC activation elicited immediate loading of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at activated promoters, followed by increases in pause-release, while repressed promoters showed opposite effects. Gains and losses in RNAPII loading were proportional to the changes in the MYC share, suggesting that repression by MYC may be partly indirect, owing to competition for limiting amounts of RNAPII. Secondary to the changes in RNAPII loading, the dynamics of elongation and pre-mRNA processing were also rapidly altered at MYC regulated genes, leading to the transient accumulation of partially or aberrantly processed mRNAs. Altogether, our results shed light on how overexpressed MYC alters the various phases of the RNAPII cycle and the resulting transcriptional response.}},

The large subunit of Pol II contains an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain that is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases during the transition from initiation to elongation, thus influencing the interaction of the C-terminal domain with different components of the initiation or the RNA-splicing apparatus5,6. Recent observations suggest that this model provides only a partial picture of the effects of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain7–12. Both the transcription-initiation machinery and the splicing machinery can form phase-separated condensates that contain large numbers of component molecules: hundreds of molecules of Pol II and mediator are concentrated in condensates at super-enhancers7,8, and large numbers of splicing factors are concentrated in nuclear speckles, some of which occur at highly active transcription sites9–12. Here we investigate whether the phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain regulates the incorporation of Pol II into phase-separated condensates that are associated with transcription initiation and splicing. We find that the hypophosphorylated C-terminal domain of Pol II is incorporated into mediator condensates and that phosphorylation by regulatory cyclin-dependent kinases reduces this incorporation. We also find that the hyperphosphorylated C-terminal domain is preferentially incorporated into condensates that are formed by splicing factors. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain drives an exchange from condensates that are involved in transcription initiation to those that are involved in RNA processing, and implicates phosphorylation as a mechanism that regulates condensate preference.}},

  abstract = {{Many proteins that bind specific DNA sequences search the genome by combining three-dimensional diffusion with one-dimensional sliding on nonspecific DNA1–5. Here we combine resonance energy transfer and fluorescence correlation measurements to characterize how individual lac repressor (LacI) molecules explore the DNA surface during the one-dimensional phase of target search. To track the rotation of sliding LacI molecules on the microsecond timescale, we use real-time single-molecule confocal laser tracking combined with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (SMCT–FCS). The fluctuations in fluorescence signal are accurately described by rotation-coupled sliding, in which LacI traverses about 40 base pairs (bp) per revolution. This distance substantially exceeds the 10.5-bp helical pitch of DNA; this suggests that the sliding protein frequently hops out of the DNA groove, which would result in the frequent bypassing of target sequences. We directly observe such bypassing using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET). A combined analysis of the smFRET and SMCT–FCS data shows that LacI hops one or two grooves (10–20 bp) every 200–700 μs. Our data suggest a trade-off between speed and accuracy during sliding: the weak nature of nonspecific protein–DNA interactions underlies operator bypassing, but also speeds up sliding. We anticipate that SMCT–FCS, which monitors rotational diffusion on the microsecond timescale while tracking individual molecules with millisecond resolution, will be applicable to the real-time investigation of many other biological interactions and will effectively extend the accessible time regime for observing these interactions by two orders of magnitude. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and real-time confocal laser tracking with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy together characterize how individual lac repressor molecules bypass operator sites while exploring the DNA surface at microsecond timescales.}},

For many transcription factors, it is unclear whether binding is the cause or the consequence of open chromatin. Here, we used datasets on open chromatin and gene expression provided by the ENCODE project to predict which transcription factors drive transitions between open and closed states. A signature of such a factor is that its expression values are correlated to chromatin accessibility at its motif across the same set of cell lines. Our method assesses this correlation while accounting for the fact that some tested cell lines are more related than others. We find many transcription factors showing evidence of driving transitions and a high proportion of these transcription factors are known pioneer factors, i.e., they play a role in opening up closed chromatin.}},

  abstract = {{<p>It has often been argued that gene-duplication events are most commonly followed by a mutational event that silences one member of the pair, while on rare occasions both members of the pair are preserved as one acquires a mutation with a beneficial function and the other retains the original function. However, empirical evidence from genome duplication events suggests that gene duplicates are preserved in genomes far more commonly and for periods far in excess of the expectations under this model, and whereas some gene duplicates clearly evolve new functions, there is little evidence that this is the most common mechanism of duplicate-gene preservation. An alternative hypothesis is that gene duplicates are frequently preserved by subfunctionalization, whereby both members of a pair experience degenerative mutations that reduce their joint levels and patterns of activity to that of the single ancestral gene. We consider the ways in which the probability of duplicate-gene preservation by such complementary mutations is modified by aspects of gene structure, degree of linkage, mutation rates and effects, and population size. Even if most mutations cause complete loss-of-subfunction, the probability of duplicate-gene preservation can be appreciable if the long-term effective population size is on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> or smaller, especially if there are more than two independently mutable subfunctions per locus. Even a moderate incidence of partial loss-of-function mutations greatly elevates the probability of preservation. The model proposed herein leads to quantitative predictions that are consistent with observations on the frequency of long-term duplicate gene preservation and with observations that indicate that a common fate of the members of duplicate-gene pairs is the partitioning of tissue-specific patterns of expression of the ancestral gene.</p>}},

  abstract = {{Predicting evolutionary paths to antibiotic resistance is key for understanding and controlling drug resistance. When considering a single final resistant genotype, epistatic contingencies among mutations restrict evolution to a small number of adaptive paths. Less attention has been given to multi-peak landscapes, and while specific peaks can be favoured, it is unknown whether and how early a commitment to final fate is made. Here we characterize a multi-peaked adaptive landscape for trimethoprim resistance by constructing all combinatorial alleles of seven resistance-conferring mutations in dihydrofolate reductase. We observe that epistatic interactions increase rather than decrease the accessibility of each peak; while they restrict the number of direct paths, they generate more indirect paths, where mutations are adaptively gained and later adaptively lost or changed. This enhanced accessibility allows evolution to proceed through many adaptive steps while delaying commitment to genotypic fate, hindering our ability to predict or control evolutionary outcomes. Antibiotic resistance can evolve through the stepwise accumulation of mutations. Here, the authors reconstruct the multistep evolutionary pathway for trimethoprim resistance and show that epistatic interactions increase rather than decrease the accessibility of each adaptive peak.}},

CAM plants fix CO2 mostly at night, when transpiration rates are low. All of the CAM pathway genes exist in ancestral C3 species, but the timing and magnitude of expression are greatly altered between C3 and CAM species. Understanding these regulatory changes is key to elucidating the mechanism by which CAM evolved from C3. Here we use two closely related species in the Orchidaceae, Erycina pusilla (CAM) and Erycina crista-galli (C3), to conduct comparative transcriptomic analyses across multiple time points. Clustering of genes with expression variation across the diel cycle revealed some canonical CAM pathway genes similarly expressed in both species, regardless of photosynthetic pathway. However, gene network construction indicated that 149 gene families had significant differences in network connectivity and were further explored for these functional enrichments. Genes involved in light sensing and ABA signaling were some of the most differently connected genes between the C3 and CAM Erycina species, in agreement with the contrasting diel patterns of stomatal conductance in C3 and CAM plants. Our results suggest changes to transcriptional cascades are important for the transition from C3 to CAM photosynthesis in Erycina.</p>}},

There are currently two distinct views of genome organization that are derived from different technologies. The first view, derived from genome-wide proximity ligation methods (e.g. Hi-C), suggests that genome organization is largely organized around chromosomes. The second view, derived from in situ imaging, suggests a central role for nuclear bodies. Yet, because microscopy and proximity-ligation methods measure different aspects of genome organization, these two views remain poorly reconciled and our overall understanding of how genomic DNA is organized within the nucleus remains incomplete. Here, we develop Split-Pool Recognition of Interactions by Tag Extension (SPRITE), which moves away from proximity-ligation and enables genome-wide detection of higher-order DNA interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known genome structures identified by Hi-C and show that the contact frequencies measured by SPRITE strongly correlate with the 3-dimensional distances measured by microscopy. In addition to known structures, SPRITE identifies two major hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are spatially arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles, respectively. We find that the majority of genomic regions exhibit preferential spatial association relative to one of these nuclear bodies, with regions that are highly transcribed by RNA Polymerase II organizing around nuclear speckles and transcriptionally inactive and centromere-proximal regions organizing around the nucleolus. Together, our results reconcile the two distinct pictures of nuclear structure and demonstrate that nuclear bodies act as inter-chromosomal hubs that shape the overall 3-dimensional packaging of genomic DNA in the nucleus.</p>}},

Various histone H3 and H4 tail acetylations mark the promoters of active genes. These modifications include acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), which blocks Polycomb-mediated trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3). H3K27ac is also widely used to identify active enhancers, and the assumption has been that profiling H3K27ac is a comprehensive way of cataloguing the set of active enhancers in mammalian cell types. Here we show that acetylation of lysine residues in the globular domain of histone H3 (lysine 64 (H3K64ac) and lysine 122 (H3K122ac)) marks active gene promoters and also a subset of active enhancers. Moreover, we find a new class of active functional enhancers that is marked by H3K122ac but lacks H3K27ac. This work suggests that, to identify enhancers, a more comprehensive analysis of histone acetylation is required than has previously been considered.}},

We defined 12,454 promoters of 8037 genes. Our analysis indicates that, due to non-promoter-associated RNA background signal, previous studies have likely overestimated the number of promoter-associated CAGE clusters by fivefold. We show that TSS distributions form a complex continuum of shapes, and that promoters active in the embryo and adult have highly similar shapes in 95\% of cases. This suggests that these distributions are generally determined by static elements such as local DNA sequence and are not modulated by dynamic signals such as histone modifications. Transcription factor binding motifs are differentially enriched as a function of promoter shape, and peaked promoter shape is correlated with both temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression. Our results contribute to the emerging view that core promoters are functionally diverse and control patterning of gene expression in Drosophila and mammals.}},

  doi = {10.1101/839944}, 
  abstract = {{<p>When interpreting sequencing data from multiple spatial or longitudinal biopsies, detecting sample mix-ups is essential yet more difficult than in studies of germline variation. In most genomic studies of tumors, genetic variation is frequently detected through pairwise comparisons of the tumor and a matched normal tissue from the sample donor, and in many cases, only somatic variants are reported. The disjoint genotype information that results hinders the use of existing tools that detect sample swaps solely based on genotypes of germline variants. To address this problem, we have developed somalier, which can operate directly on the alignments, so as not to require jointly-called germline variants. Instead, somalier extracts a small sketch of informative genetic variation for each sample. Sketches from hundreds of biopsies and normal tissues can then be compared in under a second. This speed also makes it useful for checking relatedness in large cohorts of germline samples. Somalier produces both text output and an interactive visual report that facilitates the detection and correction of sample swaps using multiple relatedness metrics. We introduce the tool and demonstrate its utility on a cohort of five glioma samples each with a normal, tumor, and cell-free DNA sample. Applying somalier to high-coverage sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project also identifies several related samples. Somalier can be applied to diverse sequencing data types and genome builds, and is freely available for academic use at github.com/brentp/somalier.</p>}},

  abstract = {{AbstractPopulation admixture is an important subject in population genetics. Inferring population demographic history with admixture under the so-called admixture network model from population genetic data is an established problem in genetics. Existing admixture network inference approaches work with single genetic variation sites. While these methods are usually very fast, they don’t fully utilize the information (e.g., linkage disequilibrium or LD) contained in population genetic data. In this paper, we develop a new admixture network inference method called GTmix. Different from existing methods, GTmix works with local gene genealogies that can be inferred from population haplotypes. Local gene genealogies represent the evolutionary history of sampled alleles and contain the LD information. GTmix performs coalescent-based maximum likelihood inference of admixture networks with the inferred genealogies based on the well-known multispecies coalescent (MSC) model. GTmix utilizes various techniques to speed up likelihood computation on the MSC model and optimal network search. Our simulations show that GTmix can infer more accurate admixture networks with much smaller data than existing methods, even when these existing methods are run with much larger data. GTmix is reasonably efficient and can analyze genetic datasets of current interests.}},

Expression of light-inducible genes is transcriptionally induced by transcription factors such as HY5. However, few detailed analyses have been carried out on the control of transcription start sites (TSSs). Of the various wavelengths of light, it is blue light (BL) that regulates physiological responses such as hypocotyl elongation and flowering time. To understand how gene expression is controlled not only by transcript abundance but also by TSS selection, we examined genome-wide TSS profiles in Arabidopsis seedlings after exposure to BL irradiation following initial growth in the dark. Thousands of genes use multiple TSSs, and some transcripts have upstream ORFs (uORFs) that take precedence over the main ORF (mORF) encoding proteins. The uORFs often function as translation inhibitors of the mORF or as triggers of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Transcription from TSSs located downstream of the uORFs in 220 genes is enhanced by BL exposure. This type of regulation is found in HY5 and HYH, major regulators of light-dependent gene expression. Translation efficiencies of the genes showing enhanced usage of these TSSs increased upon BL exposure. We also show that transcripts from TSSs upstream of uORFs in 45 of the 220 genes, including HY5, accumulated in a mutant of NMD. These results suggest that BL controls gene expression not only by enhancing transcriptions but also by choosing the TSS, and transcripts from downstream TSSs evade uORF-mediated inhibition to ensure high expression of light-regulated genes.}},

Although associated with accelerated repair of Pol II-encountered lesions and limited mutagenesis, it is still unclear how this mechanism is maintained during recovery from genotoxic stress. Here we uncover a surprising widespread gain in chromatin accessibility and preservation of the active histone mark H3K27ac after UV-irradiation. We show that the concomitant increase in Pol II release from promoter-proximal pause (PPP) sites of most active genes, PROMoter uPstream Transcripts (PROMPTs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) favors unrestrained initiation, as demonstrated by the synthesis of short nascent RNAs, including TSS-associated RNAs (start-RNAs). In accordance, drug-inhibition of the transition into elongation replenished the post-UV reduced levels of pre-initiating pol II at TSSs. Continuous engagement of new Pol II thus ensures maximal transcription-driven DNA repair of active genes and non-coding regulatory loci. Together, our results reveal an unanticipated layer regulating the UV-triggered transcriptional-response and provide physiologically relevant traction to the emerging concept that transcription initiation rate is determined by pol II pause-release dynamics.</p>}},

It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations σ1 and σ2, it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the “percentage of causation,” which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.}},

We find that the emergence of binding sites from a random sequence is generically slow under point and insertion/deletion mutational mechanisms. Strong selection, sufficient genomic sequence in which the sites can evolve, the existence of partially decayed old binding sites in the sequence, as well as certain biophysical mechanisms such as cooperativity, can accelerate the binding site gain times and make them consistent with the timescales suggested by comparative analyses of genomic data.}},

  abstract = {{Transcriptional regulatory changes have been shown to contribute to phenotypic differences between species, but many questions remain about how gene expression evolves. Here we report the first comparative study of nascent transcription in primates. We used PRO-seq to map actively transcribing RNA polymerases in resting and activated CD4+ T-cells in multiple human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque individuals, with rodents as outgroups. This approach allowed us to directly measure active transcription separately from post-transcriptional processes. We observed general conservation in coding and non-coding transcription, punctuated by numerous differences between species, particularly at distal enhancers and non-coding RNAs. Transcription factor binding sites are a primary determinant of transcriptional differences between species. We found evidence for stabilizing selection on gene expression levels and adaptive substitutions associated with lineage-specific transcription. Finally, rates of evolutionary change are strongly correlated with long-range chromatin interactions. These observations clarify the role of primary transcription in regulatory evolution.}},

  doi = {10.1534/genetics.115.185017}, 
  abstract = {{The order in which genes are organized within a genome is generally not conserved between distantly related species. However, within virus orders and families, strong conservation of gene order is observed. The factors that constrain or promote gene-order diversity are largely unknown, although the regulation of gene expression is one important constraint for viruses. Here we investigate why gene order is conserved for a positive-strand RNA virus encoding a single polyprotein in the context of its authentic multicellular host. Initially, we identified the most plausible trajectory by which alternative gene orders could evolve. Subsequently, we studied the accessibility of key steps along this evolutionary trajectory by constructing two virus intermediates: (1) duplication of a gene followed by (2) loss of the ancestral gene. We identified five barriers to the evolution of alternative gene orders. First, the number of viable positions for reordering is limited. Second, the within-host fitness of viruses with gene duplications is low compared to the wild-type virus. Third, after duplication, the ancestral gene copy is always maintained and never the duplicated one. Fourth, viruses with an alternative gene order have even lower fitness than viruses with gene duplications. Fifth, after more than half a year of evolution in isolation, viruses with an alternative gene order are still vastly inferior to the wild-type virus. Our results show that all steps along plausible evolutionary trajectories to alternative gene orders are highly unlikely. Hence, the inaccessibility of these trajectories probably contributes to the conservation of gene order in present-day viruses.}},

To address this gap, using liver and skin as a proof-of-concept tissues, we show that readily available signature genes based on expression profiles of mouse cell types can be used to deconvolute the cellular composition of human GTEx tissues. We then deconvoluted 6,829 bulk RNA-seq samples corresponding to 28 GTEx tissues and show that we are able to quantify cellular heterogeneity, determining both the different cell types present in each of the tissues and how their proportions vary between samples of the same tissue type. Conducting eQTL analyses for GTEx liver and skin samples using cell type composition estimates as interaction terms, we identified thousands of novel genetic associations that had lower effect sizes and were cell-type-associated. We further show that cell-type-associated eQTLs in skin colocalize with melanoma, malignant neoplasm, and infection signatures, indicating variants that influence gene expression in distinct skin cell types play important roles in skin traits and disease. Overall, our study provides a framework to estimate the relative fractions of different cell types in GTEx tissues using signature genes from mouse cell types and functionally characterize human genetic variation that impacts gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner.</p>}},

Throughout evolution the vast majority of Drosophila genes have remained on the same chromosome arm, but within each arm gene order has been extensively reshuffled, leading to a minimum of 921 syntenic blocks shared between the species. A repetitive sequence is found in the D. pseudoobscura genome at many junctions between adjacent syntenic blocks. Analysis of this novel repetitive element family suggests that recombination between offset elements may have given rise to many paracentric inversions, thereby contributing to the shuffling of gene order in the D. pseudoobscura lineage. Based on sequence similarity and synteny, 10,516 putative orthologs have been identified as a core gene set conserved over 25–55 million years (Myr) since the pseudoobscura/melanogaster divergence. Genes expressed in the testes had higher amino acid sequence divergence than the genome-wide average, consistent with the rapid evolution of sex-specific proteins. Cis-regulatory sequences are more conserved than random and nearby sequences between the species—but the difference is slight, suggesting that the evolution of cis-regulatory elements is flexible. Overall, a pattern of repeat-mediated chromosomal rearrangement, and high coadaptation of both male genes and cis-regulatory sequences emerges as important themes of genome divergence between these species of Drosophila.}},

Although it is widely appreciated that these systems ultimately evolved from genomic regulatory mechanisms present in single-celled stem metazoans, it remains unclear how this occurred. Here, we focus on the contribution of the non-coding portion of the genome to the evolution of animal gene regulation, specifically on recent insights from non-bilaterian metazoan lineages, and unicellular and colonial holozoan sister taxa. High-throughput next-generation sequencing, largely in bilaterian model species, has led to the discovery of tens of thousands of non-coding RNA genes (ncRNAs), including short, long and circular forms, and uncovered the central roles they play in development. Based on the analysis of non-bilaterian metazoan, unicellular holozoan and fungal genomes, the evolution of some ncRNAs, such as Piwi-interacting RNAs, correlates with the emergence of metazoan multicellularity, while others, including microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs, appear to be more ancient. Analysis of non-coding regulatory DNA and histone post-translational modifications have revealed that some cis-regulatory mechanisms, such as those associated with proximal promoters, are present in non-animal holozoans, while others appear to be metazoan innovations, most notably distal enhancers. In contrast, the cohesin-CTCF system for regulating higher-order chromatin structure and enhancer-promoter long-range interactions appears to be restricted to bilaterians. Taken together, most bilaterian non-coding regulatory mechanisms appear to have originated before the divergence of crown metazoans. However, differential expansion of non-coding RNA and cis-regulatory DNA repertoires in bilaterians may account for their increased regulatory and morphological complexity relative to non-bilaterians.}},

Parallel evolution of marine and freshwater threespine stickleback fish provides an excellent opportunity to dissect whether the same molecular mechanisms underlie repeated adaptive divergence in gene expression. Using RNA-seq of four marine-freshwater ecotype pairs from Scotland and Canada, we first identified genes with parallel divergence in expression and show that these are found near previously reported adaptive loci and show a molecular signature of selection centered around the transcription start site. With allele-specific expression assays in F1 hybrids we next show that expression divergence is predominantly driven by <i>cis</i>-regulatory control in all four river systems, a pattern that is enriched in parallel divergently expressed genes. In particular, for genes whose expression is up-regulated in parallel among freshwater fish the quantitative degree of <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-regulation is also highly correlated, suggesting a shared genetic basis across populations. This stands in contrast to genes up-regulated in parallel in marine fish, whose degree of <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-regulation is less correlated and predictable. This observed asymmetry in parallelism in how genes are up-regulated in marine and freshwater fish can be explained by differences in the evolutionary contexts of the diverging ecotypes. Finally, we show that <i>cis</i>-regulation is predominantly additive and shows greater robustness to different in genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions. We argue that these features make <i>cis</i>-regulation well-poised for rapid adaptive divergence of gene expression under conditions of on-going gene flow. Combined our study highlights how natural selection on dispersed <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements can shape the adaptive landscape of the genome.</p>}},

However, potential contributions of MMP7 genetic variations to hypertension remain unknown. In this study, we first probed for the association of a tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the <i>MMP7</i> gene promoter (-181A/G; rs11568818) with hypertension in an urban south Indian population (n=1517). The heterozygous A/G genotype showed a strong association with hypertension as compared to the A/A wild-type genotype (OR=1.641, 95\% CI=1.276-2.109; p=1x10<sup>-4</sup>); AG genotype carriers also displayed significantly higher diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure than AA genotype subjects. The study was replicated in a north Indian population (n=977) as well (OR=1.520, 95\% CI =1.106-2.090; p=0.01). Transient transfection experiments using <i>MMP7</i> promoter-luciferase reporter constructs revealed that the variant -181G allele conferred greater promoter activity than the -181A allele. Computational prediction and structure-based conformational and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggested higher binding affinity for the transcription factor CREB to the -181G promoter. In corroboration, over-expression/down-regulation of CREB and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments provided convincing evidence for stronger binding of CREB with the -181G promoter. Further, the -181G promoter also displayed an enhanced response to hypoxia and epinephrine-treatment. The higher promoter activity of -181G allele also translated to increased MMP7 protein levels. Indeed, <i>MMP7</i>-181A/G heterozygous individuals displayed elevated plasma MMP7 levels which positively correlated with blood pressure. In conclusion, the <i>MMP7</i> A-181G promoter SNP increased expression of MMP7 under pathophysiological (such as hypoxic stress and catecholamine excess) conditions via increased interactions with the transcription factor CREB and enhanced the risk for hypertension in its carriers.</p>}},

Constrained elements tend to cluster, and we identify large constrained regions that correspond well with known functional elements. While constraint density inversely correlates with mobile element density, we also show the presence of unambiguously constrained elements overlapping mammalian ancestral repeats. In addition, we describe a number of elements in this region that have undergone intense purifying selection throughout mammalian evolution, and we show that these important elements are more numerous than previously thought. These results were obtained with Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP), a statistically rigorous and biologically transparent framework for constrained element identification. GERP identifies regions at high resolution that exhibit nucleotide substitution deficits, and measures these deficits as “rejected substitutions.” Rejected substitutions reflect the intensity of past purifying selection and are used to rank and characterize constrained elements. We anticipate that GERP and the types of analyses it facilitates will provide further insights and improved annotation for the human genome as mammalian genome sequence data become richer.}},

The interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with DNA regulatory elements clearly play an important role in determining gene expression outputs, yet the regulatory logic underlying functional transcription factor binding is poorly understood. Many studies have focused on characterizing the genomic locations of TF binding, yet it is unclear to what extent TF binding at any specific locus has functional consequences with respect to gene expression output. To evaluate the context of functional TF binding we knocked down 59 TFs and chromatin modifiers in one HapMap lymphoblastoid cell line. We then identified genes whose expression was affected by the knockdowns. We intersected the gene expression data with transcription factor binding data (based on ChIP-seq and DNase-seq) within 10 kb of the transcription start sites of expressed genes. This combination of data allowed us to infer functional TF binding. Using this approach, we found that only a small subset of genes bound by a factor were differentially expressed following the knockdown of that factor, suggesting that most interactions between TF and chromatin do not result in measurable changes in gene expression levels of putative target genes. We found that functional TF binding is enriched in regulatory elements that harbor a large number of TF binding sites, at sites with predicted higher binding affinity, and at sites that are enriched in genomic regions annotated as "active enhancers."}},

Distinct first exons, driven from separate promoters, splice onto a common exon 2 and 3 but utilize different reading frames to produce two completely distinct proteins, both of which play roles in cell cycle control. INK4a, a critical element of the retinoblastoma gene pathway, binds to and inhibits the activities of CDK4 and CDK6, while ARF, a critical element of the p53 pathway, increases the level of functional p53 via interaction with MDM2. Here we clone and characterize the promoter of the human ARF gene and show that it is a CpG island characteristic of a housekeeping gene which contains numerous Sp1 sites. Both ARF and INK4a are coordinately expressed in cells except when their promoter regions become de novo methylated. In one of these situations, ARF transcription could be reactivated by treatment with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, and the reactivation kinetics of ARF and INK4a were found to differ slightly in a cell line in which both genes were silenced by methylation. The ARF promoter was also found to be highly responsive to E2F1 expression, in keeping with previous results at the RNA level. Lastly, transcription from the ARF promoter was down-regulated by wild-type p53 expression, and the magnitude of the effect correlated with the status of the endogenous p53 gene. This finding points to the existence of an autoregulatory feedback loop between p53, MDM2, and ARF, aimed at keeping p53 levels in check.}},

H3K4me3 has been ascribed roles as both an instructor of gene expression and also a downstream consequence of expression, yet neither has been convincingly proven on a genome-wide scale. Here we test these relationships using a combination of bioinformatics, modelling and experimental data from budding yeast in which the levels of H3K4me3 have been massively ablated. We find that loss of H3K4me3 has no effect on the levels of nascent transcription or transcript in the population. Moreover, we observe no change in the rates of transcription initiation, elongation, mRNA export or turnover, or in protein levels, or cell-to-cell variation of mRNA. Loss of H3K4me3 also has no effect on the large changes in gene expression patterns that follow galactose induction. Conversely, loss of RNA polymerase from the nucleus has no effect on the pattern of H3K4me3 deposition and little effect on its levels, despite much larger changes to other chromatin features. Furthermore, large genome-wide changes in transcription, both in response to environmental stress and during metabolic cycling, are not accompanied by corresponding changes in H3K4me3. Thus, despite the correlation between H3K4me3 and gene activity, neither appear to be necessary to maintain levels of the other, nor to influence their changes in response to environmental stimuli. When we compare gene classes with very different levels of H3K4me3 but highly similar transcription levels we find that H3K4me3-marked genes are those whose expression is unresponsive to environmental changes, and that their histones are less acetylated and dynamically turned-over. Constitutive genes are generally well-expressed, which may alone explain the correlation between H3K4me3 and gene expression, while the biological role of H3K4me3 may have more to do with this distinction in gene class.</p>}},

To examine how local gene environment and transcription factor regulation are coupled, we performed a combined analysis of time-course RNA-seq data of TGF-β treated MCF10A cells and related epigenomic and Hi-C data. Using Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM), we clustered differentially expressed genes based on gene expression profiles and associated transcription factors. Genes in each class have similar temporal gene expression patterns and share common transcription factors. Next, we defined a set of linear and radial distribution functions, as used in statistical physics, to measure the distributions of genes within a class both spatially and linearly along the genomic sequence. Remarkably, genes within the same class despite sometimes being separated by tens of million bases (Mb) along genomic sequence show a significantly higher tendency to be spatially close despite sometimes being separated by tens of Mb along the genomic sequence than those belonging to different classes do. Analyses extended to the process of mouse nervous system development arrived at similar conclusions.

Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.}},

  abstract = {{Green plants (Viridiplantae) include around 450,000–500,000 species1,2 of great diversity and have important roles in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here, as part of the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative, we sequenced the vegetative transcriptomes of 1,124 species that span the diversity of plants in a broad sense (Archaeplastida), including green plants (Viridiplantae), glaucophytes (Glaucophyta) and red algae (Rhodophyta). Our analysis provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining the evolution of green plants. Most inferred species relationships are well supported across multiple species tree and supermatrix analyses, but discordance among plastid and nuclear gene trees at a few important nodes highlights the complexity of plant genome evolution, including polyploidy, periods of rapid speciation, and extinction. Incomplete sorting of ancestral variation, polyploidization and massive expansions of gene families punctuate the evolutionary history of green plants. Notably, we find that large expansions of gene families preceded the origins of green plants, land plants and vascular plants, whereas whole-genome duplications are inferred to have occurred repeatedly throughout the evolution of flowering plants and ferns. The increasing availability of high-quality plant genome sequences and advances in functional genomics are enabling research on genome evolution across the green tree of life. The One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining green plant evolution that comprises the transcriptomes and genomes of diverse species of green plants.}},

We performed an integrative analysis of DNA methylation, RNA-seq, and small RNA-seq profiles from thousands of patients, including 25 diverse primary malignances and seven body sites of metastatic melanoma. We found that enhancers are consistently the most differentially methylated regions (DMR) as cancer progresses from normal to primary tumors and then to metastases, compared to other genomic features. Remarkably, identification of enhancer DMRs (eDMRs) enabled classification of primary tumors according to physiological organ systems, and in metastasis eDMRs are the most correlated with patient outcome. To further understand the eDMR role in cancer progression, we developed a model to predict genes and microRNAs that are regulated by enhancer and not promotor methylation, which shows high accuracy with chromatin architecture methods and was experimentally validated. Interestingly, among all metastatic melanoma eDMRs, the most correlated with patient survival were eDMRs that "switched" their methylation patterns back and forth between normal, primary, and metastases and target cancer drivers, e.g.,KIT We further demonstrated that eDMR target genes were modulated in melanoma by the bone metastasis microenvironment, suggesting that eDMRs respond to microenvironmental cues in metastatic niches. Our findings that aberrant methylation in cancer cells mostly affects enhancers, which contribute to tumor progression and cancer cell plasticity, will facilitate development of epigenetic anticancer approaches.}},

Although tissue-dependent splicing was frequent among untranslated exons, it explained less than half of the differences in exon usage across tissues, suggesting that most of these differences were driven by alternative transcription start and termination sites. Analysis of the FANTOM Project data confirmed widespread tissue-dependent usage of alternative transcriptional start sites. Our analysis highlights alternative initiation and termination sites of transcription as the main drivers of isoform diversity across tissues.

The recently developed Hi-C technology is an efficacious method to investigate genome packing. Here we present a detailed Hi-C map of the three-dimensional genome organization of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We find that local chromatin packing differs from the patterns seen in animals, with kilobasepair-sized segments that have much higher intrachromosome interaction rates than neighboring regions, representing a dominant local structural feature of genome conformation in A. thaliana. These regions, which appear as positive strips on two-dimensional representations of chromatin interaction, are enriched in epigenetic marks H3K27me3, H3.1, and H3.3. We also identify more than 400 insulator-like regions. Furthermore, although topologically associating domains (TADs), which are prominent in animals, are not an obvious feature of A. thaliana genome packing, we found more than 1000 regions that have properties of TAD boundaries, and a similar number of regions analogous to the interior of TADs. The insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions are each enriched for distinct epigenetic marks and are each correlated with different gene expression levels. We conclude that epigenetic modifications, gene density, and transcriptional activity combine to shape the local packing of the A. thaliana nuclear genome.}},

NELF binds the polymerase funnel, bridges two mobile polymerase modules, and contacts the trigger loop, thereby restraining Pol II mobility that is required for pause release. NELF prevents binding of the anti-pausing transcription elongation factor IIS (TFIIS). Additionally, NELF possesses two flexible ‘tentacles’ that can contact DSIF and exiting RNA.

This endomembrane system arose and diversified during a period characterized by massive expansions of gene families involved in trafficking after the acquisition of a mitochondrial endosymbiont by a prokaryotic host cell >1.8 billion years ago. Here we investigate the mechanistic link between gene duplication and the emergence of new nonendosymbiotic organelles, using a minimal biophysical model of traffic. Our model incorporates membrane-bound compartments, coat proteins and adaptors that drive vesicles to bud and segregate cargo from source compartments, and SNARE proteins and associated factors that cause vesicles to fuse into specific destination compartments. In simulations, arbitrary numbers of compartments with heterogeneous initial compositions segregate into a few compositionally distinct subsets that we term organelles. The global structure of the traffic system (i.e., the number, composition, and connectivity of organelles) is determined completely by local molecular interactions. On evolutionary timescales, duplication of the budding and fusion machinery followed by loss of cross-interactions leads to the emergence of new organelles, with increased molecular specificity being necessary to maintain larger organellar repertoires. These results clarify potential modes of early eukaryotic evolution as well as more recent eukaryotic diversification.}},

A subset of these, and the protein machineries that move material between them, define the membrane-trafficking system (MTS), the emergence of which represents a landmark in eukaryotic evolution. Unlike mitochondria and plastids, MTS organelles have autogenous origins. Much of the MTS machinery is composed of building blocks, including small GTPase, coiled-coil, beta-propeller + alpha-solenoid, and longin domains. Despite the identification of prokaryotic proteins containing these domains, only few represent direct orthologues, leaving the origins and early evolution of the MTS poorly understood. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of MTS building block homologues in the composite genome of Lokiarchaeum, the recently discovered archaeal sister clade of eukaryotes, yielding several key insights. We identify two previously unreported Eukaryotic Signature Proteins; orthologues of the Gtr/Rag family GTPases, involved in target of rapamycin complex signaling, and of the RLC7 dynein component. We could not identify golgin or SNARE (coiled-coil) or beta-propeller + alpha-solenoid orthologues, nor typical MTS domain fusions, suggesting that these either were lost from Lokiarchaeum or emerged later in eukaryotic evolution. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analyses of lokiarchaeal GTPases support a split into Ras-like and Arf-like superfamilies, with different prokaryotic antecedents, before the advent of eukaryotes. While no GTPase activating proteins or exchange factors were identified, we show that Lokiarchaeum encodes numerous roadblock domain proteins and putative longin domain proteins, confirming the latter's origin from Archaea. Altogether, our study provides new insights into the emergence and early evolution of the eukaryotic membrane-trafficking system.}},

  abstract = {{The use of genetic polymorphism data to understand the dynamics of adaptation and identify the loci that are involved has become a major pursuit of modern evolutionary genetics. In addition to the classical "hard sweep" hitchhiking model, recent research has drawn attention to the fact that the dynamics of adaptation can play out in a variety of different ways and that the specific signatures left behind in population genetic data may depend somewhat strongly on these dynamics. One particular model for which a large number of empirical examples are already known is that in which a single derived mutation arises and drifts to some low frequency before an environmental change causes the allele to become beneficial and sweeps to fixation. Here, we pursue an analytical investigation of this model, bolstered and extended via simulation study. We use coalescent theory to develop an analytical approximation for the effect of a sweep from standing variation on the genealogy at the locus of the selected allele and sites tightly linked to it. We show that the distribution of haplotypes that the selected allele is present on at the time of the environmental change can be approximated by considering recombinant haplotypes as alleles in the infinite-alleles model. We show that this approximation can be leveraged to make accurate predictions regarding patterns of genetic polymorphism following such a sweep. We then use simulations to highlight which sources of haplotypic information are likely to be most useful in distinguishing this model from neutrality, as well as from other sweep models, such as the classic hard sweep and multiple-mutation soft sweeps. We find that in general, adaptation from a unique standing variant will likely be difficult to detect on the basis of genetic polymorphism data from a single population time point alone, and when it can be detected, it will be difficult to distinguish from other varieties of selective sweeps. Samples from multiple populations and/or time points have the potential to ease this difficulty.}},

Instead, we uncovered a pervasive association with genomic repeats by showing that a large fraction of the bona fide binding sites for five of the seven transcription factors (ESR1, TP53, POU5F1, SOX2, and CTCF) are embedded in distinctive families of transposable elements. Using the age of the repeats, we established that these repeat-associated binding sites (RABS) have been associated with significant regulatory expansions throughout the mammalian phylogeny. We validated the functional significance of these RABS by showing that they are over-represented in proximity of regulated genes and that the binding motifs within these repeats have undergone evolutionary selection. Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulatory networks are highly dynamic in eukaryotic genomes and that transposable elements play an important role in expanding the repertoire of binding sites.}},

  abstract = {{Genomes of invertebrates and vertebrates exhibit highly divergent patterns of DNA methylation. Invertebrate genomes tend to be sparsely methylated, and DNA methylation is mostly targeted to a subset of transcription units (gene bodies). In a drastic contrast, vertebrate genomes are generally globally and heavily methylated, punctuated by the limited local hypo-methylation of putative regulatory regions such as promoters. These genomic differences also translate into functional differences in DNA methylation and gene regulation. While promoter DNA methylation is an important regulatory component of vertebrate gene expression, its role in invertebrate gene regulation has been little explored. Instead, gene body DNA methylation is associated with expression of invertebrate genes. However, the evolutionary steps leading to the differentiation of invertebrate and vertebrate genomic DNA methylation remain unresolved. Here we analyzed experimentally determined DNA methylation maps of several species across the invertebrate-vertebrate boundary, to elucidate how vertebrate gene methylation has evolved. We show that, in contrast to the prevailing idea, a substantial number of promoters in an invertebrate basal chordate Ciona intestinalis are methylated. Moreover, gene expression data indicate significant, epigenomic context-dependent associations between promoter methylation and expression in C. intestinalis. However, there is no evidence that promoter methylation in invertebrate chordate has been evolutionarily maintained across the invertebrate-vertebrate boundary. Rather, body-methylated invertebrate genes preferentially obtain hypo-methylated promoters among vertebrates, regardless of their promoter methylation status. Conversely, promoter methylation is preferentially found in lineage- and tissue-specific vertebrate genes. These results provide important insights into the evolutionary origin of epigenetic regulation of vertebrate gene expression.}},

  doi = {10.1101/290825}, 
  abstract = {{<p>Chromatin interactions have important roles for enhancer-promoter interactions (EPI) and regulating the transcription of genes. CTCF and cohesin proteins are located at the anchors of chromatin interactions, forming their loop structures. CTCF has insulator function limiting the activity of enhancers into the loops. DNA binding sequences of CTCF indicate their orientation bias at chromatin interaction anchors - forward-reverse (FR) orientation is frequently observed. DNA binding sequences of CTCF were found in open chromatin regions at about 40\% - 80\% of chromatin interaction anchors in Hi-C and in situ Hi-C experimental data. Though the number of chromatin interactions was about seventy thousand in Hi-C at 50kb resolution, about twenty millions of chromatin interactions were recently identified by HiChIP at 5kb resolution. It has been reported that long range of chromatin interactions tends to include less CTCF at their anchors. It is still unclear what proteins are associated with chromatin interactions. To find DNA binding motif sequences of transcription factors (TF), such as CTCF, and repeat DNA sequences affecting the interaction between enhancers and promoters of genes and their expression, first I predicted TF bound in enhancers and promoters using DNA motif sequences of TF and experimental data of open chromatin regions in monocytes and other cell types, which were obtained from public and commercial databases. Second, transcriptional target genes of each TF were predicted based on enhancer-promoter association (EPA). EPA was shortened at the genomic locations of FR or reverse-forward (RF) orientation of DNA motif sequence of a TF, which were supposed to be at chromatin interaction anchors and acted as insulator sites like CTCF. Then, the expression levels of the transcriptional target genes predicted based on the EPA were compared with those predicted from only promoters. Total 287 biased orientation of DNA motifs (159 FR and 153 RF orientation, the reverse complement sequences of some DNA motifs were also registered in databases, so the total number was smaller than the number of FR and RF) affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes significantly in CD14+ monocytes of four people in common. The same analysis was conducted in CD4+ T cells of four people. DNA motif sequences of CTCF, cohesin and other transcription factors involved in chromatin interactions were found to be a biased orientation. Transposon sequences, which are known to be involved in insulators and enhancers, showed a biased orientation. The biased orientation of DNA motif sequences tended to be co-localized in the same open chromatin regions. Moreover, for 86\% of FR and RF orientations of DNA motif sequences, EPI predicted from EPA that were shortened at the genomic locations of the biased orientation of DNA motif sequence were overlapped with chromatin interaction data (Hi-C and HiChIP) significantly more than other types of EPAs.</p>}},

  abstract = {{The search for oncogenic mutations in haematological malignancies has largely focused on coding sequence variants. These variants have been critical in understanding these complex cancers in greater detail, ultimately leading to better disease monitoring, subtyping and prognostication. In contrast, the search for oncogenic variants in the noncoding genome has proven to be challenging given the vastness of the search space, the intrinsic difficulty in assessing the impact of variants that do not code for functional proteins, and our still primitive understanding of the function harboured by large parts of the noncoding genome. Recent studies have broken ground on this quest, identifying somatically acquired and recurrent mutations in the noncoding genome that activate the expression of proto-oncogenes. In this Review, we explore some of the best-characterised examples of noncoding mutations in haematological malignancies, and highlight how a significant majority of these variants impinge on gene regulation through the formation of aberrant enhancers and promoters. We delve into the challenges faced by those that embark on a search for noncoding driver mutations, and provide a framework distilled from studies that have successfully identified such variants to overcome some of the most salient hurdles. Finally, we discuss the current therapeutic strategies being explored to target the oncogenic mechanism supported by recurrent noncoding variants. We postulate that the continued discovery and functional characterisation of somatic variants in the noncoding genome will not only advance our understanding of haematological malignancies, but offer novel therapeutic avenues and provide important insights into transcriptional regulation on a broader scale.}},

Here, by integrating ultrastructural imaging, long-range optical mapping and computational analysis of whole-genome sequencing, we demonstrate the structure of circular ecDNA. Pan-cancer analyses reveal that oncogenes encoded on ecDNA are among the most highly expressed genes in the transcriptome of the tumours, linking increased copy number with high transcription levels. Quantitative assessment of the chromatin state reveals that although ecDNA is packaged into chromatin with intact domain structure, it lacks higher-order compaction that is typical of chromosomes and displays significantly enhanced chromatin accessibility. Furthermore, ecDNA is shown to have a significantly greater number of ultra-long-range interactions with active chromatin, which provides insight into how the structure of circular ecDNA affects oncogene function, and connects ecDNA biology with modern cancer genomics and epigenetics. Imaging and sequencing approaches are combined to show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer is circular and has unique chromatin structure that amplifies oncogene output.}},

Here, we developed plant native elongating transcripts sequencing (plaNET-seq) to profile genome-wide nascent RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription during the cold-response of Arabidopsis thaliana with single-nucleotide resolution. Combined with temporal resolution, these data revealed transient genome-wide reprogramming of nascent RNAPII transcription during cold, including characteristics of RNAPII elongation and thousands of non-coding transcripts connected to gene expression. Our results suggest a role for promoter-proximal RNAPII stalling in predisposing genes for transcriptional activation during plant-environment interactions. At gene 39-ends, cold initially facilitated transcriptional termination by limiting the distance of read-through transcription. Within gene bodies, cold reduced the kinetics of co-transcriptional splicing leading to increased intragenic stalling. Our data resolved multiple distinct mechanisms by which temperature transiently altered the dynamics of nascent RNAPII transcription and associated RNA processing, illustrating potential biotechnological solutions and future focus areas to promote food security in the context of a changing climate.</p>}},

Matching the spatial transcriptome, as revealed by APEX-Seq, with the spatial proteome determined by APEX-mass spectrometry (APEX-MS) provides new insights into the organization of translation initiation complexes on active mRNAs, as well as exposing unanticipated complexity in stress granule composition, and provides a powerful and general approach to explore the spatial environment of macromolecules.</p>}},

Interestingly, we found striking changes in particular environments, such as airline flights (decreased peripheral capillary oxygen saturation [SpO2] and increased radiation exposure). These events are associated with physiological macro-phenotypes such as fatigue, providing a strong association between reduced pressure/oxygen and fatigue on high-altitude flights. Importantly, we combined biosensor information with frequent medical measurements and made two important observations: First, wearable devices were useful in identification of early signs of Lyme disease and inflammatory responses; we used this information to develop a personalized, activity-based normalization framework to identify abnormal physiological signals from longitudinal data for facile disease detection. Second, wearables distinguish physiological differences between insulin-sensitive and -resistant individuals. Overall, these results indicate that portable biosensors provide useful information for monitoring personal activities and physiology and are likely to play an important role in managing health and enabling affordable health care access to groups traditionally limited by socioeconomic class or remote geography.}},

Alternatively, they may have resulted from accidental translations of pseudogene transcripts and possess no function. Comparing between human and macaque orthologs, we show that the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio (ω) is significantly smaller for translated pseudogenes than other pseudogenes. In particular, five of 34 translated pseudogenes amenable to evolutionary analysis have ω values significantly lower than 1, indicative of the action of purifying selection. This and other findings demonstrate that some but not all translated pseudogenes have selected functions at the protein level.

Each of these genes has no protein-coding homologs in any other genome, but is supported by evidence from expression and, importantly, proteomics data. The absence of these genes in chimp and macaque cannot be explained by sequencing gaps or annotation error. High-quality sequence data indicate that these loci are noncoding DNA in other primates. Furthermore, chimp, gorilla, gibbon, and macaque share the same disabling sequence difference, supporting the inference that the ancestral sequence was noncoding over the alternative possibility of parallel gene inactivation in multiple primate lineages.

In this study, we used CAGE followed by deep sequencing to globally profile the transcript\&nbsp;5′ isoforms in the translatome and transcriptome of human HEK293 cells at single-nucleotide resolution. By comparing the two profiles, we identified the 5′ isoforms preferentially used in translatome and revealed a widespread selective usage of TSSs (32.0\%) and core promoters (48.7\%) by polysome. We discovered the transcription initiation patterns and the sequence characteristics that were highly correlated with polysome selection. We further identified 5804 genes significantly enriched or depleted in translatome and showed that polysome selection was an important contributing factor to the abundance of related gene products. Moreover, after comparison with public transcriptome CAGE data from 180 human tissues and primary cells, we raised a question on whether it is a widely adopted mechanism to regulate translation efficiency by changing the transcription initiation sites on the transcription level in cells of different conditions. Using HEK293 cells as a model, we delineated an indirect selection toward TSSs and core promoters by the translation machinery. Our findings lend additional evidence for a much closer coordination between transcription and translation, warranting future translatome studies in more cell types and conditions to develop a more intricate regulatory model for gene expression.}},

The distribution of thirteen known CPEs across four monocots (Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa ssp. japonica, Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays) and four dicots (Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera, Glycine max) reveals the structural organization of the core promoter in relation to the TATA-box as well as with respect to other CPEs.

Further, a more refined subset of annotated genes based on orthologs of the model monocot (O. sativa ssp. japonica) and dicot (A. thaliana) genomes supported the positional distribution of these thirteen known CPEs. DNA free energy profiles provided evidence that the structural properties of promoter regions are distinctly different from that of the non-regulatory genome sequence. It also showed that monocot core promoters have lower DNA free energy than dicot core promoters.

Are intronless genes under selection to avoid these motifs so as not to attract the splicing machinery to an mRNA that should not be spliced, thereby preventing the production of an aberrant transcript? Consistent with this possibility, we find that ESEs in putative recent retrocopies are at a higher density and evolving faster than those in other intronless genes, suggesting that they are being lost. Moreover, intronless genes are less dense in putative ESEs than intron-containing ones. However, this latter difference is likely due to the skewed base composition of intronless sequences, a skew that is in line with the general GC richness of few exon genes. Indeed, after controlling for such biases, we find that both intronless and intron-containing genes are denser in ESEs than expected by chance. Importantly, nucleotide-controlled analysis of evolutionary rates at synonymous sites in ESEs indicates that the ESEs in intronless genes are under purifying selection in both human and mouse. We conclude that on the loss of introns, some but not all, ESE motifs are lost, the remainder having functions beyond a role in splice promotion. These results have implications for the design of intronless transgenes and for understanding the causes of selection on synonymous sites.}},

  abstract = {{(i) A computer simulation study has been made of selection on two linked loci in small populations, where both loci were assumed to have additive effects on the character under selection with no interaction between loci. If N is the effective population size, i the intensity of selection in standard units, α and β measure the effects of the two loci on the character under selection as a proportion of the pheno-typic standard deviation and c is the crossover distance between them, it was shown that the selection process can be completely specified by Niα, Niβand Nc and the initial gene frequencies and linkage disequilibrium coefficient. It is then easily possible to generalize from computer runs at only one population size. All computer runs assumed an initial population at linkage equilibrium between the two loci. Analysis of the results was greatly simplified by considering the influence of segregation at the second locus on the chance of fixation at the first (defined as the proportion of replicate lines in which the favoured allele was eventually fixed). (ii) The effects of linkage are sufficiently described by Nc. The relationship between chance of fixation at the limit and linkage distance (expressed as 2Nc/(2Nc + 1)) was linear in the majority of computer runs. (iii) When gene frequency changes under independent segregation were small, linkage had no effect on the advance under selection. In general, segregation at the second locus had no detectable influence on the chance of fixation at the first if the gene effects at the second were less than one-half those at the first. With larger gene effects at the second locus, the chance of fixation passed through a minimum and then rose again. For two loci to have a mutual influence on one another, their effects on the character under selection should not differ by a factor of more than two. (iv) Under conditions of suitable relative gene effects, the influence of segregation at the second locus was very dependent on the initial frequency of the desirable allele. The chance of fixation at the first, plotted against initial frequency of the desirable allele at the second, passed through a minimum when the chance of fixation at the second locus was about 0·8. (v) A transformation was found which made the influence of segregation at the second locus on the chance of fixation at the first almost independent of initial gene frequency at the first and of gene effects at the first locus when these are small. (vi) In the population of gametes at final fixation, linkage was not at equilibrium and there was an excess of repulsion gametes. (vii) The results were extended to a consideration of the effect of linkage on the limits under artificial selection. Linkage proved only to be of importance when the two loci had roughly equal effects on the character under selection. The maximum effect on the advance under selection occurred when the chance of fixation at both of the loci was between 0·7 and 0·8. When the advance under selection is most sensitive to changes in recombination value, a doubling of the latter in no case increased the advance under selection by more than about 6\%. The proportion selected to give maximum advance under individual selection (0·5 under independent segregation) was increased, but only very slightly, when linkage is important. (viii) These phenomena could be satisfactorily accounted for in terms of the time scale of the selection process and the effective size of the population within which changes of gene frequency at the locus with smaller effect must take place.}},

Here, we show that the histone-fold domain protein NF-Y, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, controls the fidelity of transcription initiation at gene promoters. We report that NF-Y maintains the region upstream of TSSs in a nucleosome-depleted state while simultaneously protecting this accessible region against aberrant and/or ectopic transcription initiation. We find that loss of NF-Y binding in mammalian cells disrupts the promoter chromatin landscape, leading to nucleosomal encroachment over the canonical TSS. Importantly, this chromatin rearrangement is accompanied by upstream relocation of the transcription pre-initiation complex and ectopic transcription initiation. Further, this phenomenon generates aberrant extended transcripts that undergo translation, disrupting gene expression profiles. These results demonstrate that NF-Y is a central player in TSS selection in metazoans and highlight the deleterious consequences of inaccurate transcription initiation.</p>}},

NGS-based technologies for genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics are now increasingly focused on the characterization of individual cells. These single-cell analyses will allow researchers to uncover new and potentially unexpected biological discoveries relative to traditional profiling methods that assess bulk populations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), for example, can reveal complex and rare cell populations, uncover regulatory relationships between genes, and track the trajectories of distinct cell lineages in development. In this review, we will focus on technical challenges in single-cell isolation and library preparation and on computational analysis pipelines available for analyzing scRNA-seq data. Further technical improvements at the level of molecular and cell biology and in available bioinformatics tools will greatly facilitate both the basic science and medical applications of these sequencing technologies. Showing which genes are expressed, or switched on, in individual cells may help to reveal the first signs of disease. Each cell in an organism contains the same genetic information, but cell type and behavior depend on which genes are expressed. Previously, researchers could only sequence cells in batches, averaging the results, but technological improvements now allow sequencing of the genes expressed in an individual cell, known as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Ji Hyun Lee (Kyung Hee University, Seoul) and Duhee Bang and Byungjin Hwang (Yonsei University, Seoul) have reviewed the available scRNA-seq technologies and the strategies available to analyze the large quantities of data produced. They conclude that scRNA-seq will impact both basic and medical science, from illuminating drug resistance in cancer to revealing the complex pathways of cell differentiation during development.}},

Random sequences yield a broad range of reproducible expression levels, indicating that the fortuitous binding sites in random DNA are functional. From these data we learn models of transcriptional regulation that predict over 94\% of the expression driven from independent test data and nearly 89\% from sequences from yeast promoters. These models allow us to characterize the activity of TFs and their interactions with chromatin, and help refine cis-regulatory motifs. We find that strand, position, and helical face preferences of TFs are widespread and depend on interactions with neighboring chromatin.

Although bisulfite-sequencing based methods profile DNA methylation at a single CpG resolution, methylation levels are usually averaged over genomic regions in the downstream bioinformatic analysis. We demonstrate that on the genome level a single CpG methylation can serve as a more accurate predictor of gene expression than an average promoter / gene body methylation. We define CpG traffic lights (CpG TL) as CpG dinucleotides with a significant correlation between methylation and expression of a gene nearby. CpG TL are enriched in all regulatory regions. Among all promoters, CpG TL are especially enriched in poised ones, suggesting involvement of DNA methylation in their regulation. Yet, binding of only a handful of transcription factors, such as NRF1, ETS, STAT and IRF-family members, could be regulated by direct methylation of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) or its close proximity. For the majority of TF, an alternative scenario is more likely: methylation and inactivation of the whole regulatory element indirectly represses functional TF binding with a CpG TL being a reliable marker of such inactivation. CpG TL provide a promising insight into mechanisms of enhancer activity and gene regulation linking methylation of single CpG to gene expression. CpG TL methylation can be used as reliable markers of enhancer activity and gene expression in applications, e.g. in clinic where measuring DNA methylation is easier compared to directly measuring gene expression due to more stable nature of DNA.}},

  abstract = {{Genomic comparisons of closely related species have identified "islands" of locally elevated sequence divergence. Genomic islands may contain functional variants involved in local adaptation or reproductive isolation and may therefore play an important role in the speciation process. However, genomic islands can also arise through evolutionary processes unrelated to speciation, and examination of their properties can illuminate how new species evolve. Here, we performed scans for regions of high relative divergence (FST) in 12 species pairs of Darwin's finches at different genetic distances. In each pair, we identify genomic islands that are, on average, elevated in both relative divergence (FST) and absolute divergence (dXY). This signal indicates that haplotypes within these genomic regions became isolated from each other earlier than the rest of the genome. Interestingly, similar numbers of genomic islands of elevated dXY are observed in sympatric and allopatric species pairs, suggesting that recent gene flow is not a major factor in their formation. We find that two of the most pronounced genomic islands contain the ALX1 and HMGA2 loci, which are associated with variation in beak shape and size, respectively, suggesting that they are involved in ecological adaptation. A subset of genomic island regions, including these loci, appears to represent anciently diverged haplotypes that evolved early during the radiation of Darwin's finches. Comparative genomics data indicate that these loci, and genomic islands in general, have exceptionally low recombination rates, which may play a role in their establishment.}},

In this way, the de novo protein SynSerB3 was selected as a rescuer of cells in which serB, which encodes phosphoserine phosphatase, an enzyme essential for serine biosynthesis, was deleted. However, SynSerB3 does not rescue the deleted activity by catalyzing hydrolysis of phosphoserine. Instead, SynSerB3 up-regulates hisB, a gene encoding histidinol phosphate phosphatase. This endogenous E. coli phosphatase has promiscuous activity that, when overexpressed, compensates for the deletion of phosphoserine phosphatase. Thus, the de novo protein SynSerB3 rescues the deletion of serB by altering the natural regulation of the His operon.}},

Most metazoan polymerase II-transcribed genes carry canonical initiation with pyrimidine/purine (YR) dinucleotide, while translation machinery-associated genes carry polypyrimidine initiator (5’-TOP or TCT). By addressing the developmental regulation of TSS selection in zebrafish we uncovered a class of dual-initiation promoters in thousands of genes, including snoRNA host genes. 5’-TOP/TCT initiation is intertwined with canonical initiation and used divergently in hundreds of dual-initiation promoters during maternal to zygotic transition. Dual-initiation in snoRNA host genes selectively generates host and snoRNA with often different spatio-temporal expression. Dual-initiation promoters are pervasive in human and fruit fly, reflecting evolutionary conservation. We propose that dual-initiation on shared promoters represents a composite promoter architecture, which can function both coordinately and divergently to diversify RNAs. The functional significance of start site choice in promoter architectures is little understood. Here the authors identify in zebrafish development and mammalian cells a class of dual-initiation promoters, in which non-canonical YC dinucleotides reflecting 5’-TOP/TCT initiation are intertwined with canonical YR-initiation.}},

As understanding of genetics developed after 1900, the new genetic discoveries were incorporated into evolutionary biology. The resulting general principles were summarized by Julian Huxley in his 1942 book Evolution: the modern synthesis . Here, we examine how recent advances in genetics, developmental biology and molecular biology, including epigenetics, relate to today's understanding of the evolution of adaptations. We illustrate how careful genetic studies have repeatedly shown that apparently puzzling results in a wide diversity of organisms involve processes that are consistent with neo-Darwinism. They do not support important roles in adaptation for processes such as directed mutation or the inheritance of acquired characters, and therefore no radical revision of our understanding of the mechanism of adaptive evolution is needed.}},

To investigate when spatial genome organization is first established during development, we examined chromatin conformation during <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis and observed the emergence of chromatin architecture within a tight time window that coincides with the onset of transcription activation in the zygote. Prior to zygotic genome activation, the genome is mostly unstructured. Early expressed genes serve as nucleation sites for topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries. Activation of gene expression coincides with the establishment of TADs throughout the genome and co-localization of housekeeping gene clusters, which remain stable in subsequent stages of development. However, the appearance of TAD boundaries is independent of transcription and requires the transcription factor Zelda for locus-specific TAD boundary insulation. These results offer insight into when spatial organization of the genome emerges and identify a key factor that helps trigger this architecture.</p>}},

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1613300114}, 
  abstract = {{CpG, 5'-C-phosphate-G-3', islands (CGIs) have long been known for their association with enhancers, silencers, and promoters, and for their epigenetic signatures. They are maintained in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in a poised but inactive state via the formation of bivalent chromatin containing both active and repressive marks. CGIs also occur within coding sequences, where their functional role has remained obscure. Intragenic CGIs (iCGIs) are largely absent from housekeeping genes, but they are found in all genes associated with organ development and cell lineage control. In this paper, we investigated the epigenetic status of iCGIs and found that they too reside in bivalent chromatin in ESCs. Cell type-specific DNA methylation of iCGIs in differentiated cells was linked to the loss of both the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks, and disruption of physical interaction with promoter regions, resulting in transcriptional activation of key regulators of differentiation such as PAXs, HOXs, and WNTs. The differential epigenetic modification of iCGIs appears to be mediated by cell type-specific transcription factors distinct from those bound by promoter, and these transcription factors may be involved in the hypermethylation of iCGIs upon cell differentiation. iCGIs thus play a key role in the cell type-specific regulation of transcription.}},

Whereas most DNA in our genome is normally bound by other proteins (histones) and packaged into units called nucleosomes, a specific subset of tissue-specific regulatory regions is responsible for tissue-specific gene expression; these active regions are nucleosome-depleted and bound by transcription factors. We use two techniques to identify these open chromatin regions, in a normal tissue and a Ras V12 induced cancer tissue. We discovered a remarkable change in the accessible regulatory landscape between these two tissues, with several thousand regions becoming more accessible in the cancer tissue. We identified two transcription factors known to be involved in cancer (AP-1 and Stat92E) controlling these newly accessible regulatory regions. Finally, we introduced a mutation resulting in Stat92E becoming non-functional in the cancer tissue, which decreased the severity of the tumor. Our study shows that open chromatin profiling can be used to identify complex in vivo processes, and we shed new light on Ras dependent cancer development.}},

In a comprehensive study of the yeast chromatin remodelers and the Mot1p-NC2 regulators of TATA-binding protein (TBP), we detected synthetic genetic interactions indicative of suppression of intragenic transcription. Conditional depletion of Mot1p or NC2 in absence of the ISW1 remodeler, but not in the absence of other chromatin remodelers, activated the cryptic FLO8 promoter. Likewise, conditional depletion of Mot1p or NC2 in deletion backgrounds of the H3K36 methyltransferase Set2p or the Asf1p-Rtt106p histone H3-H4 chaperones, important factors involved in maintaining a repressive chromatin environment, resulted in increased intragenic FLO8 transcripts. Activity of the cryptic FLO8 promoter is associated with reduced H3 levels, increased TBP binding and tri-methylation of H3K4 and is independent of Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase function. These data reveal cooperation of negative regulation of TBP with specific chromatin regulators to inhibit intragenic transcription.}},

We quantified transcription from cis-regulatory elements without the influence of RNA turnover, and show that enhancer–promoter pairs are generally activated simultaneously on stimulation.

In response to environmental cues that signal the onset of environmental adversity, daphnids produce males and reproduce sexually. The environmental cues that stimulate the sexual reproductive phase are well known; however, the endocrine signals that transduce these environmental cues remain unknown. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the crustacean juvenoid hormone, methyl farnesoate, is a male sex determinant in this species. Continuous exposure to aqueous concentrations of methyl farnesoate greater than approximately 30 nM stimulated a concentration-dependent production of male-containing broods of organisms. Short-term exposures to methyl farnesoate during periods of egg and embryo maturation revealed that male sex determination occurred during a specific 12-hour period of ovarian egg development. Exposure of eggs to 400 nM methyl farnesoate during this sensitive developmental period resulted in the production of all-male broods of offspring, while exposure to concentrations as low as 52 nM produced mixed broods of males and females. This active concentration range of methyl farnesoate is consistent with levels measured in the hemolymph of some decapod crustaceans. These results demonstrate that methyl farnesoate is capable of programming daphnid embryos to develop into males and is likely the endocrine factor responsible for initiating the sexual reproductive phase in these organisms.}},

  abstract = {{<p>Enhancers and promoters both regulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors; however, the degree to which enhancer vs. promoter activity is due to differences in their sequences or to genomic context is the subject of ongoing debate. We examined this question by analyzing the sequences of thousands of transcribed enhancers and promoters from hundreds of cellular contexts previously identified by Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE). Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers trained on counts of all possible 6-bp-long sequences (6-mers) were able to accurately distinguish promoters from enhancers and distinguish their breadth of activity across tissues. Classifiers trained to predict enhancer activity also performed well when applied to promoter prediction tasks, but promoter-trained classifiers performed poorly on enhancers. This suggests that the learned sequence patterns predictive of enhancer activity generalize to promoters, but not vice versa. Our classifiers also indicate that there are functionally relevant differences in enhancer and promoter GC content beyond the influence of CpG islands. Furthermore, sequences characteristic of broad promoter or broad enhancer activity matched different transcription factors (TFs), with predicted ETS and RFX binding sites indicative of promoters and AP-1 sites indicative of enhancers. Finally, we evaluated the ability of our models to distinguish enhancers and promoters defined by histone modifications. Separating these classes was substantially more difficult, and this difference may contribute to ongoing debates about the similarity of enhancers and promoters. In summary, our results suggest that high confidence transcribed enhancers and promoters can largely be distinguished based on biologically relevant sequence properties.</p>}},

The second mechanism of compensation stems from alternative metabolic pathways, regulatory networks, and so on. The relative importance of the two mechanisms has not been investigated except for a limited study, which suggested that the role of duplicate genes in compensation is negligible10. The availability of fitness data for a nearly complete set of single-gene-deletion mutants of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome11 has enabled us to carry out a genome-wide evaluation of the role of duplicate genes in genetic robustness against null mutations. Here we show that there is a significantly higher probability of functional compensation for a duplicate gene than for a singleton, a high correlation between the frequency of compensation and the sequence similarity of two duplicates, and a higher probability of a severe fitness effect when the duplicate copy that is more highly expressed is deleted. We estimate that in S. cerevisiae at least a quarter of those gene deletions that have no phenotype are compensated by duplicate genes.}},

Despite the need for complementarity between interacting partners, such pairwise systems seem to be capable of high levels of evolutionary divergence, even when subject to strong selection. Such behavior is a consequence of the diminishing advantages of increasing binding affinity between partners, the multiplicity of evolutionary pathways between selectively equivalent alternatives, and the stochastic nature of evolutionary processes. Because mutation pressure toward reduced affinity conflicts with selective pressure for greater interaction, situations can arise in which the expected distribution of the degree of matching between interacting partners is bimodal, even in the face of constant selection. Although biomolecules with larger numbers of interacting partners are subject to increased levels of evolutionary conservation, their more numerous partners need not converge on a single sequence motif or be increasingly constrained in more complex systems. These results suggest that most phylogenetic differences in the sequences of binding interfaces are not the result of adaptive fine tuning but a simple consequence of random genetic drift.}},

To address this gap, using liver and skin as a proof-of-concept tissues, we show that readily available signature genes based on expression profiles of mouse cell types can be used to deconvolute the cellular composition of human GTEx tissues. We then deconvoluted 6,829 bulk RNA-seq samples corresponding to 28 GTEx tissues and show that we are able to quantify cellular heterogeneity, determining both the different cell types present in each of the tissues and how their proportions vary between samples of the same tissue type. Conducting eQTL analyses for GTEx liver and skin samples using cell type composition estimates as interaction terms, we identified thousands of novel genetic associations that had lower effect sizes and were cell-type-associated. We further show that cell-type-associated eQTLs in skin colocalize with melanoma, malignant neoplasm, and infection signatures, indicating variants that influence gene expression in distinct skin cell types play important roles in skin traits and disease. Overall, our study provides a framework to estimate the relative fractions of different cell types in GTEx tissues using signature genes from mouse cell types and functionally characterize human genetic variation that impacts gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner.</p>}},

These are fundamental questions at the forefront of our evolutionary epigenomic understanding.

Here we compared whole genome DNA methylation maps from brains of humans, chimpanzees and also rhesus macaques (outgroup) to elucidate DNA methylation changes during human brain evolution. Moreover, we validated that our approach is highly robust by further examining 38 human-specific DMRs using targeted deep genomic and bisulfite sequencing in an independent panel of 37 individuals from five primate species. Our unbiased genome-scan identified human brain differentially methylated regions (DMRs), irrespective of their associations with annotated genes. Remarkably, over half of the newly identified DMRs locate in intergenic regions or gene bodies. Nevertheless, their regulatory potential is on par with those of promoter DMRs. An intriguing observation is that DMRs are enriched in active chromatin loops, suggesting human-specific evolutionary remodeling at a higher-order chromatin structure. These findings indicate that there is substantial reprogramming of epigenomic landscapes during human brain evolution involving noncoding regions.}},

  abstract = {{The core-promoter, a stretch of DNA surrounding the transcription start site (TSS), is a major integration-point for regulatory-signals controlling gene-transcription. Cellular differentiation is marked by divergence in transcriptional repertoire and cell-cycling behaviour between cells of different fates. The role promoter-associated gene-regulatory-networks play in development-associated transitions in cell-cycle-dynamics is poorly understood. This study demonstrates in a vertebrate embryo, how core-promoter variations define transcriptional output in cells transitioning from a proliferative to cell-lineage specifying phenotype. Assessment of cell proliferation across zebrafish embryo segmentation, using the FUCCI transgenic cell-cycle-phase marker, revealed a spatial and lineage-specific separation in cell-cycling behaviour. To investigate the role differential promoter usage plays in this process, cap-analysis-of-gene-expression (CAGE) was performed on cells segregated by cycling dynamics. This analysis revealed a dramatic increase in tissue-specific gene expression, concurrent with slowed cycling behaviour. We revealed a distinct sharpening in TSS utilization in genes upregulated in slowly cycling, differentiating tissues, associated with enhanced utilization of the TATA-box, in addition to Sp1 binding-sites. In contrast, genes upregulated in rapidly cycling cells carry broad distribution of TSS utilization, coupled with enrichment for the CCAAT-box. These promoter features appear to correspond to cell-cycle-dynamic rather than tissue/cell-lineage origin. Moreover, we observed genes with cell-cycle-dynamic-associated transitioning in TSS distribution and differential utilization of alternative promoters. These results demonstrate the regulatory role of core-promoters in cell-cycle-dependent transcription regulation, during embryo-development.}},

Observations from the genomic databases for several eukaryotic species suggest that duplicate genes arise at a very high rate, on average 0.01 per gene per million years. Most duplicated genes experience a brief period of relaxed selection early in their history, with a moderate fraction of them evolving in an effectively neutral manner during this period. However, the vast majority of gene duplicates are silenced within a few million years, with the few survivors subsequently experiencing strong purifying selection. Although duplicate genes may only rarely evolve new functions, the stochastic silencing of such genes may play a significant role in the passive origin of new species.}},

How the genetic architectures of complex traits vary between populations and subsequent effects on genetic prediction are not well understood, in part due to the historical paucity of GWAS in populations of non-European ancestry. We used data from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) cohort to characterize the genetic architecture of gene expression within and between diverse populations. Genotype and monocyte gene expression were available in individuals with African American (AFA, n=233), Hispanic (HIS, n=352), and European (CAU, n=578) ancestry. We performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping in each population and show genetic correlation of gene expression depends on shared ancestry proportions. Using elastic net modeling with cross validation to optimize genotypic predictors of gene expression in each population, we show the genetic architecture of gene expression for most predictable genes is sparse. We found the best predicted gene, <i>TACSTD2</i>, was the same across populations with R<sup>2</sup> \&gt; 0.86 in each population. However, we identified a subset of genes that are well-predicted in one population, but poorly predicted in another. We show these differences in predictive performance are due to allele frequency differences between populations. Using genotype weights trained in MESA to predict gene expression in independent populations showed that a training set with ancestry similar to the test set is better at predicting gene expression in test populations, demonstrating an urgent need for diverse population sampling in genomics. Our predictive models and performance statistics in diverse cohorts are made publicly available for use in transcriptome mapping methods at https://github.com/WheelerLab/DivPop.</p>}},

In these cases, how is regulatory information from multiple enhancers combined to determine the overall expression output of their shared promoter? To investigate this question, we quantified nascent transcription driven by a pair shadow enhancers, each individual of the pair, and their duplications in Drosophila embryos using live imaging. This set of constructs allows us to quantify the "computation" made by the pairs of enhancers: their combined output expression as a function of the expression that they drive separately. We show that the computation performed by these shadow enhancers and duplications varies across the expression pattern, implying that how their activities are combined depends on the transcriptional regulators bound to the enhancers in different parts of the embryo. Characterizing the computation made by multiple enhancers is a critical first step in developing conceptual and computational models of gene expression at the locus level, where multiple enhancers collaborate.</p>}},

We characterize genetic diversity within P. pacificus and investigate the population genetic processes shaping this diversity. P. pacificus is 10 times more diverse than C. elegans and exhibits substantial population structure that allows us to probe its evolution on multiple timescales. Consistent with reduced effective recombination in this self-fertilizing species, we find haplotype blocks that span several megabases. Using the P. exspectatus genome as an outgroup, we polarized variation in P. pacificus and found a site frequency spectrum (SFS) that decays more rapidly than expected in neutral models. The SFS at putatively neutral sites is U shaped, which is a characteristic feature of pervasive linked selection. Based on the additional findings (i) that the majority of nonsynonymous variation is eliminated over timescales on the order of the separation between clades, (ii) that diversity is reduced in gene-rich regions, and (iii) that highly differentiated clades show very similar patterns of diversity, we conclude that purifying selection on many mutations with weak effects is a major force shaping genetic diversity in P. pacificus.}},

Tardigrades are microscopic eight-legged animals that are famous for their ability to survive extreme conditions. Genome sequencing, direct confirmation of physical linkage, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that a large fraction of the H. dujardini genome is derived from diverse bacteria as well as plants, fungi, and Archaea. We estimate that approximately one-sixth of tardigrade genes entered by HGT, nearly double the fraction found in the most extreme cases of HGT into animals known to date. Foreign genes have supplemented, expanded, and even replaced some metazoan gene families within the tardigrade genome. Our results demonstrate that an unexpectedly large fraction of an animal genome can be derived from foreign sources.

FAIRE results in the preferential recovery of open chromatin DNA fragments that are not bound by nucleosomes, an evolutionarily conserved indicator of regulatory activity, which are then sequenced. Despite the power of the approach, FAIRE-seq has not yet been applied to the study of non-model insects. In this investigation, we utilized FAIRE-seq to profile open chromatin and identify likely regulatory elements throughout the genome of the human disease vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. We then assessed genetic variation in the regulatory elements of dengue virus susceptible (Moyo-S) and refractory (Moyo-R) mosquito strains. Analysis of sequence data obtained through next generation sequencing of FAIRE DNA isolated from A. aegypti embryos revealed >121,000 FAIRE peaks (FPs), many of which clustered in the 1 kb 5’ upstream flanking regions of genes known to be expressed at this stage. As expected, known transcription factor consensus binding sites were enriched in the FPs, and of these FoxA1, Hunchback, Gfi, Klf4, MYB/ph3 and Sox9 are most predominant. All of the elements tested in vivo were confirmed to drive gene expression in transgenic Drosophila reporter assays. Of the >13,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) recently identified in dengue virus-susceptible and refractory mosquito strains, 3365 were found to map to FPs. FAIRE-seq analysis of open chromatin in A. aegypti permitted genome-wide discovery of CREs.

We performed Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) with RNA isolated from D. pulex within three developmental states: sexual females, asexual females, and males. Identified TSSs were utilized to generate a "Daphnia Promoter Atlas," i.e., a catalog of active promoters across the surveyed states. Analysis of the distribution of promoters revealed evidence for widespread alternative promoter usage in D. pulex, in addition to a prominent fraction of compactly-arranged promoters in divergent orientations. We carried out de novo motif discovery using CAGE-defined TSSs and identified eight candidate core promoter motifs; this collection includes canonical promoter elements (e.g., TATA and Initiator) in addition to others lacking obvious orthologs. A comparison of promoter activities found evidence for considerable state-specific differential gene expression between states. Our work represents the first global definition of transcription initiation and promoter architecture in crustaceans. The Daphnia Promoter Atlas presented here provides a valuable resource for comparative study of cis-regulatory regions in metazoans, as well as for investigations into the circuitries that underpin meiosis and parthenogenesis.}},

  abstract = {{The evolutionary history of a gene helps predict its function and relationship to phenotypic traits. Although sequence conservation is commonly used to decipher gene function and assess medical relevance, methods for functional inference from comparative expression data are lacking. Here, we use RNA-seq across seven tissues from 17 mammalian species to show that expression evolution across mammals is accurately modeled by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a commonly proposed model of continuous trait evolution. We apply this model to identify expression pathways under neutral, stabilizing, and directional selection. We further demonstrate novel applications of this model to quantify the extent of stabilizing selection on a gene's expression, parameterize the distribution of each gene's optimal expression level, and detect deleterious expression levels in expression data from individual patients. Our work provides a statistical framework for interpreting expression data across species and in disease.}},

  abstract = {{A major premise in evolutionary developmental biology is that regulatory changes, often involving cis-regulatory elements, are responsible for much morphological evolution. This premise is supported by recent investigations of animal development, but information is just beginning to accumulate regarding whether it also applies to the evolution of plant morphology1–4. Here, we identify the genetic differences between species in the genus Clarkia that are responsible for evolutionary change in an ecologically important element of floral colour patterns: spot position. The evolutionary shift in spot position was due to two simple genetic changes that resulted in the appearance of a transcription factor binding site mutation in the R2R3 Myb gene that changes spot formation. These genetic changes caused R2R3 Myb to be activated by a different transcription factor that is expressed in a different position in the petal. These results suggest that the regulatory rewiring paradigm is as applicable to plants as it is to animals, and support the hypothesis that cis-regulatory changes may often play a role in plant morphological evolution. In Clarkia species, petals have spots at specific positions, an important ecological trait that affects pollination. The evolution of this trait is explained by mutations in a single promoter that rewire a developmental transcription factor network.}},

Additionally, most promoters have an engaged polymerase upstream and in an orientation opposite to the annotated gene.

  abstract = {{<p>Drosophila bithorax complex (BX-C) is one of the best model systems for studying the role of boundaries (insulators) in gene regulation. Expression of three homeotic genes, Ubx, abd-A, and Abd-B, is orchestrated by nine parasegment-specific regulatory domains. These domains are flanked by boundary elements, which function to block crosstalk between adjacent domains, ensuring that they can act autonomously. Paradoxically, seven of the BX-C regulatory domains are separated from their gene target by at least one boundary, and must “jump over” the intervening boundaries. To understand the jumping mechanism, the Mcp boundary was replaced with Fab-7 and Fab-8. Mcp is located between the iab-4 and iab-5 domains, and defines the border between the set of regulatory domains controlling abd-A and Abd-B. When Mcp is replaced by Fab-7 or Fab-8, they direct the iab-4 domain (which regulates abd-A) to inappropriately activate Abd-B in abdominal segment A4. For the Fab-8 replacement, ectopic induction was only observed when it was inserted in the same orientation as the endogenous Fab-8 boundary. A similar orientation dependence for bypass activity was observed when Fab-7 was replaced by Fab-8. Thus, boundaries perform two opposite functions in the context of BX-C – they block crosstalk between neighboring regulatory domains, but at the same time actively facilitate long distance communication between the regulatory domains and their respective target genes.</p>}},

  abstract = {{We have surveyed the evolutionary trends of mammalian promoters and upstream sequences, utilising large sets of experimentally supported transcription start sites (TSSs). With 30,969 well-defined TSSs from mouse and 26,341 from human, there are sufficient numbers to draw statistically meaningful conclusions and to consider differences between promoter types. Unlike previous smaller studies, we have considered the effects of insertions, deletions, and transposable elements as well as nucleotide substitutions. The rate of promoter evolution relative to that of control sequences has not been consistent between lineages nor within lineages over time. The most pronounced manifestation of this heterotachy is the increased rate of evolution in primate promoters. This increase is seen across different classes of mutation, including substitutions and micro-indel events. We investigated the relationship between promoter and coding sequence selective constraint and suggest that they are generally uncorrelated. This analysis also identified a small number of mouse promoters associated with the immune response that are under positive selection in rodents. We demonstrate significant differences in divergence between functional promoter categories and identify a category of promoters, not associated with conventional protein-coding genes, that has the highest rates of divergence across mammals. We find that evolutionary rates vary both on a fine scale within mammalian promoters and also between different functional classes of promoters. The discovery of heterotachy in promoter evolution, in particular the accelerated evolution of primate promoters, has important implications for our understanding of human evolution and for strategies to detect primate-specific regulatory elements.}},

While genetic association studies have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with susceptibility, these studies are not practical for identifying rare variants. Efforts to distinguish pathogenic variants from benign rare variants have leveraged the genetic code to identify deleterious protein-coding alleles, but no analogous code exists for non-coding variants. Therefore, ascertaining which rare variants have phenotypic effects remains a major challenge. Rare non-coding variants have been associated with extreme gene expression in studies using single tissues, but their effects across tissues are unknown. Here we identify gene expression outliers, or individuals showing extreme expression levels for a particular gene, across 44 human tissues by using combined analyses of whole genomes and multi-tissue RNA-sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6p release. We find that 58\% of underexpression and 28\% of overexpression outliers have nearby conserved rare variants compared to 8\% of non-outliers. Additionally, we developed RIVER (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation), a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates expression data to predict a regulatory effect for rare variants with higher accuracy than models using genomic annotations alone. Overall, we demonstrate that rare variants contribute to large gene expression changes across tissues and provide an integrative method for interpretation of rare variants in individual genomes.}},

Nevertheless, the consequences of the choice of the sliding window size have never before been analysed. We propose an automatic adaptation of this size to each motif distribution profile. This approach allows a better characterization of the topological constraints of the motifs and the lists of genes containing them. Moreover, our approach allowed us to highlight a nonconstant frequency of occurrence of spurious motifs that could be counter-selected close to their functional area. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of in silico prediction of TFBSs and the sensitivity of the promoter cartography, we propose, in addition to automatic adaptation of window size, consideration of the nonconstant frequency of motifs in promoters.}},

We include our own negative results from attempts to reconstitute the stripe 2 enhancer from the even-skipped locus and discuss possible ways forward.

  abstract = {{Plants need to be able to sense and respond to changes in temperature, light levels and other aspects of their environment. One way in which plants can rapidly respond to these changes is to modify how genes involved in growth and other processes are expressed. Therefore, understanding how this happens may help us to improve the ability of crops to grow when exposed to drought or other extreme environmental conditions. Most previous studies into the effect of the environment on plant gene expression have been carried out under controlled conditions in a laboratory. These findings cannot reflect the full range of gene expression patterns that occur in the natural environment, where multiple factors (e.g. sunlight, water, nutrients) may vary at the same time. Therefore, it is important to also analyze the effect of fluctuations in multiple environmental factors in more complex field experiments. Plessis et al. developed mathematical models to analyze the gene expression patterns of rice plants grown in the tropical environment of the Philippines using two different farming practices. One field of rice was flooded and constantly supplied with fresh water (referred to as the irrigated field), while the other field was dry and only received water from rainfall (the rainfed field). The experiments show that temperature and levels of sunlight (including UV radiation) have a strong impact on gene expression in the rice plants. Short-term variations in temperature and sunlight levels also have the most consistent effect across the different fields and seasons tested. However, for many genes, the plants grown in the irrigated field responded to the changes in environmental conditions in a different way to the plants grown in the rainfed field. Further analysis identified groups of genes whose expression combined responses to several environmental factors at the same time. For example, certain genes that responded to increases in sunlight in the absence of drought responded to both sunlight levels and the shortage of water when a drought occurred. The next step is to test more types of environments and climates to be able to predict gene expression responses under future climatic conditions.}},

Studies in the past decade indicate that a large number of lncRNAs are enriched in the nucleus and originate from transcriptionally active regulatory elements. These lncRNAs associate with transcription factors and chromatin regulatory elements to fine-tune the transcriptional output of protein coding genes. Importantly, lncRNAs display exquisite tissue specificity in their expression. Understanding how lncRNAs associate with their protein or nucleic acid partners and how they modulate gene expression provides insight into their scope of biological function.

Here, total RNA samples from budding yeast cells were analyzed to identify the intersect between adenylation state and gene expression in response to loss of the major cytoplasmic deadenylase Ccr4. Furthermore, concordant changes to gene expression and adenylation-state were demonstrated in the classic Crabtree-Warburg metabolic shift. Because all polyadenylated RNA is interrogated by the approach, alternative adenylation sites, noncoding RNA and RNA-decay intermediates were also identified.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms driving such expression variation remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first rigorously confirmed that duplicate genes indeed have higher gene expression variation than singleton genes in several aspects, i.e. responses to environmental perturbation, between-strain divergence, and expression noise. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we further analyzed a previously published expression dataset of yeast segregants produced from genetic crosses. We dissected the observed expression divergence between segregant strains into cis- and trans-variabilities, and demonstrated that trans-regulation effect can explain larger fraction of the expression variation than cis-regulation effect. This is true for both duplicate genes and singleton genes. In contrast, we found, between a pair of sister paralogs, cis-variability explains more of the expression divergence between the paralogs than trans-variability. We next investigated the presence of cis- and trans-features that are associated with elevated expression variations. For cis-acting regulation, duplicate genes have higher genetic diversity in their promoters and coding regions than singleton genes. For trans-acting regulation, duplicate and singleton genes are differentially regulated by chromatin regulators and transcription factors, and duplicate genes are more severely affected by the deletion of histone tails. These results showed that both cis-and trans-factors have great effect in causing the increased expression variation of duplicate genes, and explained the previously observed differences in transcription regulation between duplicate genes and singleton genes.}},

There is limited knowledge of core TFs, and thus models of core regulatory circuitry, for most cell types. We recently discovered that genes encoding known core TFs forming CRCs are driven by super-enhancers, which provides an opportunity to systematically predict CRCs in poorly studied cell types through super-enhancer mapping. Here, we use super-enhancer maps to generate CRC models for 75 human cell and tissue types.

Although maturation is remarkably variable, certain mechanisms, including a minimum size or state threshold, are proposed to underlie the process across a broad diversity of taxa. Recent evidence suggests that thresholds may themselves be developmentally plastic, and in the crustacean Daphnia pulex it is unclear whether maturation follows a threshold or is a gradual process more akin to a rate. Changes in gene expression across four instars before and during maturation were compared in a cDNA microarray experiment. Developmental stage was treated statistically both as a discontinuous and as a continuous variable, to determine whether genes showed gradual or discrete changes in expression. The continuous analysis identified a greater number of genes with significant differential expression (45) than the discontinuous analysis (11). The majority of genes, including those coding for histones, factors relating to transcription and cell cycle processes, and a putative developmental hormone showed continuous increases or decreases in expression from the first to the fourth instars that were studied, suggestive of a prolonged and gradual maturation process. Three genes coding for a fused vitellogenin/superoxide dismutase showed increases in expression following the second instar and coincided with the posited maturation threshold, but even their expression increased in a continuous fashion.}},

In addition to substitutions, evolutionary events such as gene duplication and loss (as well as horizontal transfer) play a major role in gene evolution, and many phylogenetic models have been developed in order to reconstruct and study these events. However, these models typically make the simplifying assumption that population-related effects such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) are negligible. While this assumption may have been reasonable in some settings, it has become increasingly problematic as increased genome sequencing has led to denser phylogenies, where effects such as ILS are more prominent. To address this challenge, we present a new probabilistic model, DLCoal, that defines gene duplication and loss in a population setting, such that coalescence and ILS can be directly addressed. Interestingly, this model implies that in addition to the usual gene tree and species tree, there exists a third tree, the locus tree, which will likely have many applications. Using this model, we develop the first general reconciliation method that accurately infers gene duplications and losses in the presence of ILS, and we show its improved inference of orthologs, paralogs, duplications, and losses for a variety of clades, including flies, fungi, and primates. Also, our simulations show that gene duplications increase the frequency of ILS, further illustrating the importance of a joint model. Going forward, we believe that this unified model can offer insights to questions in both phylogenetics and population genetics.}},

Over the past decade, next-generation sequencing has fostered development of a handful of techniques (i.e. GRO-seq, PRO-seq, TT-seq and NET-seq) that map unprocessed transcripts originating from both the coding and the noncoding portion of the genome. Unlike steady-state RNA sequencing, nascent RNA profiling mirrors the real-time activity of RNA Polymerases and provides an accurate readout of transcriptome-wide variations that occur during short time frames (i.e. response to external stimuli or rapid metabolic changes). Some species of nuclear RNAs, albeit functional, have a short half-life and can only be accurately gauged by nascent RNA techniques (i.e. lincRNAs and eRNAs). Furthermore, these techniques capture uncapped post-cleavage RNA at termination sites or promoter-associated antisense RNAs, providing a unique insight into RNAPII dynamics and processivity. Here we present a run-on assay with 4s-UTP labelling, followed by reversible biotinylation and affinity purification via streptavidin. Our protocol allows streamlined sample preparation within less than 3 days. We named the technique fastGRO (fast Global Run-On). We show that fastGRO is highly reproducible and yields a more complete and extensive coverage of nascent RNA than comparable techniques. Importantly, we demonstrate that fastGRO is scalable and can be performed with as few as 0.5x10\textasciicircum6 cells.}},

In this study, we show that arbitrarily defined parameterizations of genetic effects seemingly consistent with non-additive gene actions can also capture the majority of genetic variation. This reveals a logical flaw in using the relative magnitudes of variance components to indicate the relative importance of additive and non-additive gene actions. We discuss the implications and propose that variance component analyses should not be used to infer the genetic architecture of quantitative traits.}},

  abstract = {{Thermal performance curves are widely used to describe how ambient temperature impacts different attributes of ectothermic organisms, from protein function to life-history traits, and to predict the potential effects of global warming on ecological systems. Nonetheless, from an analytical standpoint, they remain primarily heuristic and few attempts have been made to develop a formal framework to characterize these curves and disentangle which factors contribute to their variation. Here we employ a nonlinear regression approach to assess if they vary systematically in shape depending on the performance proxy of choice. We compare curves at contrasting levels of organization, namely photosynthetic rates in plants ( n = 43), running speeds in lizards ( n = 51) and intrinsic rates of population increase in insects ( n = 47), and show with discriminant analyses that differences lie in a single dimension accounting for 99.1\% of the variation, resulting in 75.8\% of classification accuracy. Differences revolve primarily around the thermal range for elevated performance (greater than or equal to 50\% of maximum performance), which is broader for photosynthetic rates (median of 26.4°C), intermediate for running speeds (19.5°C) and narrower for intrinsic rates of increase (12.5°C). We contend, confounding taxonomic factors aside, that these differences reflect contrasting levels of biological organization, and hypothesize that the thermal range for elevated performance should decrease at higher organization levels. In this scenario, instantaneous or short-term measures of performance may grossly overestimate the thermal safety margins for population growth and reproduction. Taken together, our analyses suggest that descriptors of the curve are highly correlated and respond in tandem, potentially resulting in systematic variation in shape across organization levels. Future studies should take into consideration this potential bias, address if it constitutes a general pattern and, if so, explain why and how it emerges.

To address this question, we determined the transcriptional activity of a large number of chromosomally integrated promoter constructs and monitored binding of transcription factors assumed to play a role in CpG island activity. This revealed that CpG density significantly improves motif-based prediction of transcription factor binding. Our experiments also show that high CpG density alone is insufficient for transcriptional activity, yet results in increased transcriptional output when combined with particular transcription factor motifs. However, this CpG contribution to promoter activity is independent of DNA methyltransferase activity. Together this refines our understanding of mammalian promoter regulation as it shows that high CpG density within CpG islands directly contributes to an environment permissive for full transcriptional activity.}},

Paradoxically, although host cells repress these elements by multiple mechanisms, they are transcribed and are even activated under stress conditions. Here, we describe a new mechanism of retrotransposon regulation through transcription start site (TSS) selection by altered nucleosome occupancy. We show that Fun30 chromatin remodelers cooperate to maintain a high level of nucleosome occupancy at retrotransposon‐flanking long terminal repeat (LTR) elements. This enforces the use of a downstream TSS and the production of a truncated RNA incapable of reverse transcription and retrotransposition. However, in stressed cells, nucleosome occupancy at LTR elements is reduced, and the TSS shifts to allow for productive transcription. We propose that controlled retrotransposon transcription from a nonproductive TSS allows for rapid stress‐induced activation, while preventing uncontrolled transposon activity in the genome. ![][1]</img> Retrotransposons can be activated under cellular stress conditions or at specific developmental stages.

Several transcriptional characteristics are known to be associated with core types, including distribution patterns of transcription start sites (TSSs) and selection between tissue-specific and constitutive expression profiles. However, their relationship to gene structure is poorly understood. In this report, we carried a comparative analysis of three Arabidopsis core types, TATA, GA, and Coreless, with regard to gene structure. Our genome-wide investigation was based on the peak TSS positions in promoters that had been identified in a large-scale experimental analysis. This analysis revealed that the types of core promoter are related with the room for promoters that is measured as the distance from the TSS to the end of the upstream gene, the distance from the TSS to the start position of the coding sequence (CDS), and the number and species of the cis-regulatory elements. Of these, it was found that the distance from the TSS to the CDS has a tight, inverse correlation to the expression level, and thus the observed relationship to the core type appears to be indirect. However, promoter length and preference of cis-elements are thought to be a direct reflection of core type-specific transcriptional initiation mechanisms.}},

  abstract = {{Transposable elements (TEs) and other repetitive DNA can accumulate in the absence of recombination, a process contributing to the degeneration of Y-chromosomes and other non-recombining genome portions. A similar accumulation of repetitive DNA is expected for asexually reproducing species, given their entire genome is effectively non-recombining. We tested this expectation by comparing the whole-genome TE loads of five asexual arthropod lineages and their sexual relatives, including asexual and sexual lineages of crustaceans (Daphnia water fleas), insects (Leptopilina wasps) and mites (Oribatida). Surprisingly, there was no evidence for increased TE load in genomes of asexual as compared to sexual lineages, neither for all classes of repetitive elements combined, or specific TE families. Our study therefore suggests that non-recombining genomes do not accumulate TEs like non-recombining genomic regions of sexual lineages. Even if a slight but undetected increase of TEs were caused by asexual reproduction, it appears to be negligible compared to variance between species caused by processes unrelated to reproductive mode. It remains to be determined if molecular mechanisms underlying genome regulation in asexuals hamper TE activity. Alternatively, the differences in TE dynamics between non-recombining genomes in asexual lineages vs non-recombining genome portions in sexual species might stem from selection for benign TEs in asexual lineages because of the lack of genetic conflict between TEs and their hosts, and/or because asexual lineages may only arise from sexual ancestors with particularly low TE loads.}},

  abstract = {{Departures from the standard genetic code in eukaryotic nuclear genomes are known for only a handful of lineages and only a few genetic code variants seem to exist outside the ciliates, the most creative group in this regard. Most frequent code modifications entail reassignment of the UAG and UAA codons, with evidence for at least 13 independent cases of a coordinated change in the meaning of both codons. However, no change affecting each of the two codons separately has been documented, suggesting the existence of underlying evolutionary or mechanistic constraints. Here, we present the discovery of two new variants of the nuclear genetic code, in which UAG is translated as an amino acid while UAA is kept as a termination codon (along with UGA). The first variant occurs in an organism noticed in a (meta)transcriptome from the heteropteran Lygus hesperus and demonstrated to be a novel insect-dwelling member of Rhizaria (specifically Sainouroidea). This first documented case of a rhizarian with a non-canonical genetic code employs UAG to encode leucine and represents an unprecedented change among nuclear codon reassignments. The second code variant was found in the recently described anaerobic flagellate Iotanema spirale (Metamonada: Fornicata). Analyses of transcriptomic data revealed that I. spirale uses UAG to encode glutamine, similarly to the most common variant of a non-canonical code known from several unrelated eukaryotic groups, including hexamitin diplomonads (also a lineage of fornicates). However, in these organisms, UAA also encodes glutamine, whereas it is the primary termination codon in I. spirale. Along with phylogenetic evidence for distant relationship of I. spirale and hexamitins, this indicates two independent genetic code changes in fornicates. Our study documents, for the first time, that evolutionary changes of the meaning of UAG and UAA codons in nuclear genomes can be decoupled and that the interpretation of the two codons by the cytoplasmic translation apparatus is mechanistically separable. The latter conclusion has interesting implications for possibilities of genetic code engineering in eukaryotes. We also present a newly developed generally applicable phylogeny-informed method for inferring the meaning of reassigned codons.}},

  doi = {10.1101/568774}, 
  abstract = {{MMP7 (Matrilysin), a potent extracellular matrix degrading enzyme with wide substrate specificity, is emerging as a new regulator of cardiovascular diseases including coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis. However, potential contributions of MMP7 genetic variations to hypertension remain unknown. In this study, we first probed for the association of a tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MMP7 gene promoter (-181A/G; rs11568818) with hypertension in an urban south Indian population (n=1517). The heterozygous A/G genotype showed a strong association with hypertension as compared to the A/A wild-type genotype (OR=1.641, 95\% CI=1.276-2.109; p=1x10-4); AG genotype carriers also displayed significantly higher diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure than AA genotype subjects. The study was replicated in a north Indian population (n=977) as well (OR=1.520, 95\% CI =1.106-2.090; p=0.01). Transient transfection experiments using MMP7 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs revealed that the variant -181G allele conferred greater promoter activity than the -181A allele. Computational prediction and structure-based conformational and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggested higher binding affinity for the transcription factor CREB to the -181G promoter. In corroboration, over-expression/down-regulation of CREB and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments provided convincing evidence for stronger binding of CREB with the -181G promoter. Further, the -181G promoter also displayed an enhanced response to hypoxia and epinephrine-treatment. The higher promoter activity of -181G allele also translated to increased MMP7 protein levels. Indeed, MMP7 -181A/G heterozygous individuals displayed elevated plasma MMP7 levels which positively correlated with blood pressure. In conclusion, the MMP7 A-181G promoter SNP increased expression of MMP7 under pathophysiological (such as hypoxic stress and catecholamine excess) conditions via increased interactions with the transcription factor CREB and enhanced the risk for hypertension in its carriers.}},

It is becoming increasingly evident that they also constitute prime target elements through which diversity and flexibility in the complex patterns of gene expression in multicellular organisms are created. The use of multiple promoters and transcription start sites is apparently a frequently used mechanism, whereas at the same time there is considerable variation and complexity in the patterns of alternative promoter usage. This review discusses the use of alternative promoters as a versatile mechanism to create diversity and flexibility in the regulation of gene expression. Alternative promoter usage can influence gene expression in very diverse ways. The level of transcription initiation can vary between alternative promoters, the turnover or translation efficiency of mRNA isoforms with different leader exons can differ, alternative promoters can have different tissue specificity and react differently to some signals, and finally, alternative promoter usage can lead to the generation of protein isoforms differing at the amino terminus.}},

ATI is based on electrophoretic separation of protein-bound DNA sequences from a highly complex DNA library and subsequent mass-spectrometric identification of the DNA-bound proteins. We applied ATI to four mouse tissues and mouse embryonic stem cells and found that, in a given tissue or cell type, a small set of TFs, which bound to only ∼10 distinct motifs, displayed strong DNA-binding activity. Some of these TFs were found in all cell types, whereas others were specific TFs known to determine cell fate in the analyzed tissue or cell type. We also show that a small number of TFs determined the accessible chromatin landscape of a cell, suggesting that gene regulatory logic may be simpler than previously appreciated.}},

By contrast, much less is known about cancer-causing mutations in non-coding regions. Here we perform deep sequencing in 360 primary breast cancers and develop computational methods to identify significantly mutated promoters. Clear signals are found in the promoters of three genes. FOXA1, a known driver of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, harbours a mutational hotspot in its promoter leading to overexpression through increased E2F binding. RMRP and NEAT1, two non-coding RNA genes, carry mutations that affect protein binding to their promoters and alter expression levels. Our study shows that promoter regions harbour recurrent mutations in cancer with functional consequences and that the mutations occur at similar frequencies as in coding regions. Power analyses indicate that more such regions remain to be discovered through deep sequencing of adequately sized cohorts of patients. High-depth sequencing of targeted regions in primary breast cancer identifies mutated promoter elements with recurrent mutations at specific and/or nearby bases, suggesting selection of certain non-coding events. Many cancer genomic studies have characterized the landscape of driver mutations in protein-coding regions, but there has been limited exploration of non-coding regions. Gad Getz and colleagues searched for significantly mutated regulatory regions with high-depth sequencing of targeted regions in 360 primary breast cancers. They identified significantly mutated promoter elements associated with nine genes, and found recurrent mutations at specific and/or nearby bases, suggesting targeting of a specific element. For three of these genes, FOXA1, RMRP and NEAT1, they show that these recurrent promoter-proximal mutations influence gene expression and protein binding affinity. The authors suggest that further deep sequencing studies in larger cohorts could identify more as yet undiscovered promoter regions.}},

  doi = {10.1101/709014}, 
  abstract = {{H3K4me3 is a near-universal histone modification found predominantly at the 5’ region of genes, with a well-documented association with gene activity. H3K4me3 has been ascribed roles as both an instructor of gene expression and also a downstream consequence of expression, yet neither has been convincingly proven on a genome-wide scale. Here we test these relationships using a combination of bioinformatics, modelling and experimental data from budding yeast in which the levels of H3K4me3 have been massively ablated. We find that loss of H3K4me3 has no effect on the levels of nascent transcription or transcript in the population. Moreover, we observe no change in the rates of transcription initiation, elongation, mRNA export or turnover, or in protein levels, or cell-to-cell variation of mRNA. Loss of H3K4me3 also has no effect on the large changes in gene expression patterns that follow galactose induction. Conversely, loss of RNA polymerase from the nucleus has no effect on the pattern of H3K4me3 deposition and little effect on its levels, despite much larger changes to other chromatin features. Furthermore, large genome-wide changes in transcription, both in response to environmental stress and during metabolic cycling, are not accompanied by corresponding changes in H3K4me3. Thus, despite the correlation between H3K4me3 and gene activity, neither appear to be necessary to maintain levels of the other, nor to influence their changes in response to environmental stimuli. When we compare gene classes with very different levels of H3K4me3 but highly similar transcription levels we find that H3K4me3-marked genes are those whose expression is unresponsive to environmental changes, and that their histones are less acetylated and dynamically turned-over. Constitutive genes are generally well-expressed, which may alone explain the correlation between H3K4me3 and gene expression, while the biological role of H3K4me3 may have more to do with this distinction in gene class.}},

In this article we make such a systematic investigation, based on a microscopic model of gene regulation that incorporates stochastic effects. In particular, we show how operator strength and operator multiplicity affect this variability. We examine different modes of transcription factor binding to complex promoters (cooperative, independent, simultaneous) and how each of these affects the level of variability in transcriptional output from cell-to-cell. We propose that direct comparison between in vivo single-cell experiments and theoretical predictions for the moments of the probability distribution of mRNA number per cell can be used to test kinetic models of gene regulation. The emphasis of the discussion is on prokaryotic gene regulation, but our analysis can be extended to eukaryotic cells as well.}},

Working under the assumption that local ancient repeat elements of DHSs are under neutral evolution, we discovered that ∼0.44\% of DHSs are under accelerated evolution (ace-DHSs). We found that ace-DHSs tend to be more active than background DHSs, and are strongly associated with epigenetic marks of active transcription. The target genes of ace-DHSs are significantly enriched in neuron-related functions, and their expression levels are positively selected in the human brain. Thus, these lines of evidences strongly suggest that accelerated evolution on regulatory sequences plays important role in the evolution of human-specific phenotypes.}},

  abstract = {{<p>Heritable variation in gene expression is common within species. Much of this variation is due to genetic changes at loci other than the affected gene and is thus trans-acting. This trans-regulatory variation is often polygenic, with individual variants typically having small effects, making the genetic architecture of trans-regulatory variation challenging to study. Consequently, key questions about trans-regulatory variation remain, including how selection affects this variation and how trans-regulatory variants are distributed throughout the genome and within species. Here, we show that trans-regulatory variation affecting TDH3 promoter activity is common among strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Comparing this variation to neutral models of trans-regulatory evolution based on empirical measures of mutational effects revealed that stabilizing selection has constrained this variation. Using a powerful quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping method, we identified \textbackslashtextasciitilde100 loci altering expression between a reference strain and each of three genetically distinct strains. In all three cases, the non-reference strain alleles increased and decreased TDH3 promoter activity with similar frequencies, suggesting that stabilizing selection maintained many trans-acting variants with opposing effects. Loci altering expression were located throughout the genome, with many loci being strain specific and others being shared among multiple strains. These findings are consistent with theory showing stabilizing selection for quantitative traits can maintain many alleles with opposing effects, and the wide-spread distribution of QTL throughout the genome is consistent with the omnigenic model of complex trait variation. Furthermore, the prevalence of alleles with opposing effects might provide raw material for compensatory evolution and developmental systems drift.</p>}},

  abstract = {{Genetically identical cells exposed to the same environment display variability in gene expression (noise), with important consequences for the fidelity of cellular regulation and biological function. Although population average gene expression is tightly coupled to growth-rate, the effects of changes in environmental conditions on expression variability are not known. Here, we measure the single-cell expression distributions of \textbackslashtextasciitilde900 S. cerevisiae promoters across four environmental conditions using flow cytometry, and find that gene expression noise is tightly coupled to the environment and is generally higher at lower growth rates. Nutrient-poor conditions, which support lower growth rates, display elevated levels of noise for most promoters, regardless of their specific expression values. We present a simple model of noise in expression that results from having an asynchronous population, with cells at different cell cycle stages, and with different partitioning of the cells between the stages at different growth rates. This model predicts non-monotonic global changes in noise at different growth rates as well as overall higher noise for cell cycle regulated genes in all conditions. The consistency between this model and our data, as well as with noise measurements of cells growing in a chemostat at well-defined growth rates, suggests that cell-cycle heterogeneity is a major contributor to gene expression noise. Finally, we identify gene and promoter features that play a role in gene expression noise across conditions. Our results show the existence of growth-related global changes in gene expression noise and suggest their potential phenotypic implications in noise-driven processes, such as persistence, survival after treatment and responsiveness to fluctuating environments.}},

The large subunit of Pol II contains an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain that is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases during the transition from initiation to elongation, thus influencing the interaction of the C-terminal domain with different components of the initiation or the RNA-splicing apparatus5,6. Recent observations suggest that this model provides only a partial picture of the effects of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain7–12. Both the transcription-initiation machinery and the splicing machinery can form phase-separated condensates that contain large numbers of component molecules: hundreds of molecules of Pol II and mediator are concentrated in condensates at super-enhancers7,8, and large numbers of splicing factors are concentrated in nuclear speckles, some of which occur at highly active transcription sites9–12. Here we investigate whether the phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain regulates the incorporation of Pol II into phase-separated condensates that are associated with transcription initiation and splicing. We find that the hypophosphorylated C-terminal domain of Pol II is incorporated into mediator condensates and that phosphorylation by regulatory cyclin-dependent kinases reduces this incorporation. We also find that the hyperphosphorylated C-terminal domain is preferentially incorporated into condensates that are formed by splicing factors. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain drives an exchange from condensates that are involved in transcription initiation to those that are involved in RNA processing, and implicates phosphorylation as a mechanism that regulates condensate preference. RNA polymerase II with a hypophosphorylated C-terminal domain preferentially incorporates into mediator condensates, and with a hyperphosphorylated C-terminal domain into splicing-factor condensates, revealing phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism in condensate preference.}},

  abstract = {{Transcription is a highly regulated process that supplies living cells with coding and non-coding RNA molecules. Failure to properly regulate transcription is associated with human pathologies, including cancers. RNA polymerase II is the enzyme complex that synthesizes messenger RNAs that are then translated into proteins. In spite of its complexity, RNA polymerase requires a plethora of general transcription factors to be recruited to the transcription start site as part of a large transcription pre-initiation complex, and to help it gain access to the transcribed strand of the DNA. This chapter reviews the structure and function of these eukaryotic transcription pre-initiation complexes, with a particular emphasis on two of its constituents, the multisubunit complexes TFIID and TFIIH. We also compare the overall architecture of the RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex with those of RNA polymerases I and III, involved in transcription of ribosomal RNA and non-coding RNAs such as tRNAs and snRNAs, and discuss the general, conserved features that are applicable to all eukaryotic RNA polymerase systems.}},

  abstract = {{A three-dimensional chromatin state underpins the structural and functional basis of the genome by bringing regulatory elements and genes into close spatial proximity to ensure proper, cell-type specific gene expression profiles. Here, we performed Hi-C chromosome conformation capture sequencing to investigate how three-dimensional chromatin organization is disrupted in the context of copy number variation, long-range epigenetic remodelling and atypical gene expression programs in prostate cancer. We find that cancer cells retain the ability to segment their genomes into megabase-sized topologically associated domains (TADs), however these domains are generally smaller due to establishment of additional domain boundaries. Interestingly, a large proportion of the new cancer-specific domain boundaries occur at regions that display copy number variation. Notably, a common deletion on 17p13.1 in prostate cancer spanning the TP53 tumour suppressor locus results in bifurcation of a single TAD into two distinct smaller TADs. Change in domain structure is also accompanied by novel cancer-specific chromatin interactions within the TADs that are enriched at regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters and insulators, and associated with alterations in gene expression. We also show that differential chromatin interactions across regulatory regions occur within long-range epigenetically activated or silenced regions of concordant gene activation or repression in prostate cancer. Finally, we present a novel visualisation tool that enables integrated exploration of Hi-C interaction data, the transcriptome and epigenome. This study provides new insights into the relationship between long-range epigenetic and genomic dysregulation and changes in higher-order chromatin interactions in cancer.}},

To date, information on the underlying selection dynamics and the involved genome regions is mainly available for bacteria–phage systems or only one of the antagonists of a eukaryotic host–pathogen interaction. We add to our understanding of these important coevolutionary interactions using an experimental host–pathogen model, which includes the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and its pathogen <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>. We combined experimental evolution with time-shift experiments, in which a focal host or pathogen is tested against a coevolved antagonist from the past, present, or future, followed by genomic analysis. We show that (<i>i</i>) coevolution occurs rapidly within few generations, (<i>ii</i>) temporal coadaptation at the phenotypic level is found in parallel across replicate populations, consistent with antagonistic frequency-dependent selection, (<i>iii</i>) genomic changes in the pathogen match the phenotypic pattern and include copy number variations of a toxin-encoding plasmid, and (<i>iv</i>) host genomic changes do not match the phenotypic pattern and likely involve selective responses at more than one locus. By exploring the dynamics of coevolution at the phenotypic and genomic level for both host and pathogen simultaneously, our findings demonstrate a more complex model of the Red Queen, consisting of distinct selective processes acting on the two antagonists during rapid and reciprocal coadaptation.</p>}},

Many transcription elongation regulators must function simultaneously to coordinate these processes, yet few strategies exist to explore the complement of factors regulating specific stages of transcription. To this end, we developed a strategy to purify Pol II elongation complexes from subgenic regions of a single gene, namely the 5′ and 3′ regions, using sequences in the nascent RNA. Applying this strategy to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we determined the specific set of factors that interact with Pol II at precise stages during transcription. We identify many known region‐specific factors as well as determine unappreciated associations of regulatory factors during early and late stages of transcription. These data reveal a role for the transcription termination factor, Rai1, in regulating the early stages of transcription genome‐wide and support the role of Bye1 as a negative regulator of early elongation. We also demonstrate a role for the ubiquitin ligase, Bre1, in regulating Pol II dynamics during the latter stages of transcription. These data and our approach to analyze subgenic transcription elongation complexes will shed new light on the myriad factors that regulate the different stages of transcription and coordinate co‐transcriptional processes. ![][1]</img> Subgenic isolation of RNA polymerase II transcription elongation complexes reveals unique 5′ and 3′ elongation complexes and uncovers roles for Rai1 and Bye1 in regulating early elongation and Bre1 in regulating late‐stage elongation.

We find that coupled sense and anti-sense TSSs precisely define the boundaries of a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) that is highly enriched in transcription factor (TF) motifs. Notably, as the distance between sense and anti-sense TSSs increases, so does the size of the NDR, the level of signal-dependent TF binding, and gene activation. We further discover a group of anti-sense TSSs in macrophages with an enhancer-like chromatin signature. Interestingly, this signature identifies divergent promoters that are activated during immune challenge. We propose that anti-sense promoters serve as platforms for TF binding and establishment of active chromatin to further regulate or enhance sense-strand mRNA expression.}},

This identifies the impact of promoter structure on initiation dynamics in relation to nucleosomal occupancy. Additionally, perturbation of transcriptional initiation reveals an unexpectedly high turnover of polymerases at paused promoters-an observation confirmed at the level of nascent RNAs. These observations argue that absence of elongation is largely caused by premature termination rather than by stable polymerase stalling. In support of this non-processive model, we observe that induction of the paused heat shock promoter depends on continuous initiation.

  abstract = {{Studies of regulatory activity and gene expression have revealed an intriguing dichotomy: there is substantial turnover in the regulatory activity of orthologous sequences between species; however, the expression level of orthologous genes is largely conserved. Understanding how distal regulatory elements, e.g., enhancers, evolve and function is critical, as alterations in gene expression levels can drive the development of both complex disease and functional divergence between species. In this study, we investigated determinants of the conservation of regulatory enhancer activity for orthologous sequences across mammalian evolution. Using liver enhancers identified from genome-wide histone modification profiles in ten diverse mammalian species, we compared orthologous sequences that exhibited regulatory activity in all species (conserved-activity enhancers) to shared sequences active only in a single species (species-specific-activity enhancers). Conserved-activity enhancers have greater regulatory potential than species-specific-activity enhancers, as quantified by both the density and diversity of transcription factor binding motifs. Consistent with their greater regulatory potential, conserved-activity enhancers have greater regulatory activity in humans than species-specific-enhancers: they are active across more cellular contexts, and they regulate more genes than species-specific-activity enhancers. Furthermore, the genes regulated by conserved-activity enhancers are expressed in more tissues and are less tolerant of loss-of-function mutations than those targeted by species-specific-activity enhancers. These consistent results across various stages of gene regulation demonstrate that conserved-activity enhancers are more pleiotropic than their species-specific-activity counterparts. This suggests that pleiotropy is associated with the conservation of regulatory across mammalian evolution.}},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004432}, 
  abstract = {{Robustness, defined as tolerance to perturbations such as mutations and environmental fluctuations, is pervasive in biological systems. However, robustness often coexists with its counterpart, evolvability-the ability of perturbations to generate new phenotypes. Previous models of gene regulatory network evolution have shown that robustness evolves under stabilizing selection, but it is unclear how robustness and evolvability will emerge in common coevolutionary scenarios. We consider a two-species model of coevolution involving one host and one parasite population. By using two interacting species, key model parameters that determine the fitness landscapes become emergent properties of the model, avoiding the need to impose these parameters externally. In our study, parasites are modeled on species such as cuckoos where mimicry of the host phenotype confers high fitness to the parasite but lower fitness to the host. Here, frequent phenotype changes are favored as each population continually adapts to the other population. Sensitivity evolves at the network level such that point mutations can induce large phenotype changes. Crucially, the sensitive points of the network are broadly distributed throughout the network and continually relocate. Each time sensitive points in the network are mutated, new ones appear to take their place. We have therefore named this phenomenon "whack-a-mole" sensitivity, after a popular fun park game. We predict that this type of sensitivity will evolve under conditions of strong directional selection, an observation that helps interpret existing experimental evidence, for example, during the emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance.}},

We develop a strategy to simulate these two types of data that avoids the pitfalls of existing strategies that have been used to mimic bulk transcriptional data. We found that the accuracy of the algorithms measured in terms of AUROC and AUPRC was moderate, by and large, although the methods were better in recovering interactions in the artificial networks than the Boolean models. Techniques that did not require pseudotime-ordered cells were more accurate, in general. There were an excess of feed-forward loops in predicted networks than in the Boolean models. The observation that the endpoints of many false positive edges were connected by paths of length two in the Boolean models suggested that indirect effects may be predominant in the outputs of these algorithms. The outputs of the methods were quite inconsistent with each other, indicating that combining these approaches using ensembles is likely to be challenging. We present recommendations on how to create simulated gene expression datasets for testing GRN inference algorithms.

Here, we review the different approaches that have been developed for identifying promoters and their regulatory elements. We discuss the detection of cis-acting regulatory elements using word-counting or probabilistic methods (so-called "search by signal" methods) and the delineation of promoters by considering both sequence content and structural features ("search by content" methods). As an example of search by content, we explored in greater detail the association of promoters with CpG islands. However, due to differences in sequence content, the parameters used to detect CpG islands in humans and other vertebrates cannot be used for plants. Therefore, a preliminary attempt was made to define parameters that could possibly define CpG and CpNpG islands in Arabidopsis, by exploring the compositional landscape around the transcriptional start site. To this end, a data set of more than 5,000 gene sequences was built, including the promoter region, the 5'-untranslated region, and the first introns and coding exons. Preliminary analysis shows that promoter location based on the detection of potential CpG/CpNpG islands in the Arabidopsis genome is not straightforward. Nevertheless, because the landscape of CpG/CpNpG islands differs considerably between promoters and introns on the one side and exons (whether coding or not) on the other, more sophisticated approaches can probably be developed for the successful detection of "putative" CpG and CpNpG islands in plants.}},

To better understand the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms that give rise to plasticity in gene expression, we quantified the effects of 235 single nucleotide mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TDH3 promoter (PTDH3) on the activity of this promoter in media containing glucose, galactose, or glycerol as a carbon source. We found that the distributions of mutational effects differed among environments because many mutations altered the plastic response exhibited by the wild type allele. Comparing the effects of these mutations to the effects of 30 PTDH3 polymorphisms on expression plasticity in the same environments provided evidence of natural selection acting to prevent the plastic response in PTDH3 activity between glucose and galactose from becoming larger. The largest changes in expression plasticity were observed between fermentable (glucose or galactose) and non-fermentable (glycerol) carbon sources and were caused by mutations located in the RAP1 and GCR1 transcription factor binding sites. Mutations altered expression plasticity most frequently between the two fermentable environments, however, with mutations causing significant changes in plasticity between glucose and galactose distributed throughout the promoter, suggesting they might affect chromatin structure. Taken together, these results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying gene-by-environment interactions affecting gene expression as well as the evolutionary dynamics affecting natural variation in plasticity of gene expression.</p>}},

The first half acts as dominant-negative isoform suppressing poison cassette exon inclusion and instead promoting the retention of flanking introns containing repeated SRSF7 binding sites.

Crystal structures of the BAF component BAF45C indicate that monomethylation, but not trimethylation, is accommodated by BAF45C’s H3K4-binding site.

When applied to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, motif regressor identified the ROX1 and YAP1 motifs from Rox1p and Yap1p overexpression experiments, respectively; predicted that Gcn4p may have increased activity in YAP1 deletion mutants; reported a group of motifs (including GCN4, PHO4, MET4, STRE, USR1, RAP1, M3A, and M3B) that may mediate the transcriptional response to amino acid starvation; and found all of the known cell-cycle regulation motifs from 18 expression microarrays over two cell cycles.}},

We combined microdissection, translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) in nontransgenic animals, and quantitative nanoCAGE sequencing to obtain a snapshot of RNAs bound to cytoplasmic or rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER)-associated ribosomes in the PC and its dendrites.

In this study, we introduce a concise new method that selectively sequences from the 5'-end of mRNA and used it to identify TSS in four Drosophila species, including Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. pseudoobscura. For verification, we compared our results in D. melanogaster with known annotations, published 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends data, and with RNAseq from the same mRNA pool. Then, we paired 2,849 D. melanogaster TSS with its closest equivalent TSS in each species (likely to be its true ortholog) using the available multiple sequence alignments. Most of the D. melanogaster TSSs were successfully paired with an ortholog in each species (83\%, 86\%, and 55\% for D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. pseudoobscura, respectively). On the basis of the number and distribution of reads mapped at each TSS, we also estimated promoter-specific expression (PSE) and TSS peak shape, respectively. Among paired TSS orthologs, the location and promoter activity were largely conserved. TSS location appears important as PSE, and TSS peak shape was more frequently divergent among TSS that had moved. Unpaired TSS were surprisingly common in D. pseudoobscura. An increased mutation rate upstream of TSS might explain this pattern. We found an enrichment of ribosomal protein genes among diverged TSS, suggesting that TSS evolution is not uniform across the genome. © The Author 2013.}},

Given that enhancer-promoter (EP) interactions generally occur via common protein complexes, it is unclear whether EP pairing is predominantly deterministic or proximity guided.

By re-analyzing transcriptome datasets, we find that the transcription of gene neighbors is correlated over distances that scale with genome size. We experimentally show that non-specific EP interactions can explain such correlation, and that EP distance acts as a scaling factor for the transcriptional influence of an enhancer. We propose that enhancer sharing is commonplace among eukaryotes, and that EP distance is an important layer of information in gene regulation.}},

These promoter-proximal polymerases are inhibited from further elongation by detergent-sensitive factors, and knockdown of negative elongation factor, NELF, reduces their levels. These results not only solidify the notion that pausing occurs at most promoters, but demonstrate that it is the major rate-limiting step in early transcription at these promoters.

In all three species, we find that divergent transcription is initiated from two separate core promoter sequences and promoter regions display competition between histone modifications on the + 1 and -1 nucleosomes. In contrast, promoter directionality, sequence composition surrounding promoters, and positional enrichment of chromatin states, are different across species. Integrative models of H3K4me3 levels and core promoter sequence are highly predictive of promoter and enhancer directionality and support two directional classes, skewed and balanced. The relative importance of features to these models are clearly distinct for promoters and enhancers. Differences in regulatory architecture within and between metazoans are therefore abundant, arguing against a unified eukaryotic model.}},

  abstract = {{MOTIVATION:The majority of disease-associated variants identified in genome-wide association studies reside in noncoding regions of the genome with regulatory roles. Thus being able to interpret the functional consequence of a variant is essential for identifying causal variants in the analysis of genome-wide association studies.

RESULTS:We present GERV (generative evaluation of regulatory variants), a novel computational method for predicting regulatory variants that affect transcription factor binding. GERV learns a k-mer-based generative model of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data, and scores variants by computing the change of predicted ChIP-seq reads between the reference and alternate allele. The k-mers learned by GERV capture more sequence determinants of transcription factor binding than a motif-based approach alone, including both a transcription factor's canonical motif and associated co-factor motifs. We show that GERV outperforms existing methods in predicting single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with allele-specific binding. GERV correctly predicts a validated causal variant among linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms and prioritizes the variants previously reported to modulate the binding of FOXA1 in breast cancer cell lines. Thus, GERV provides a powerful approach for functionally annotating and prioritizing causal variants for experimental follow-up analysis.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:The implementation of GERV and related data are available at http://gerv.csail.mit.edu/.

  abstract = {{Understanding how cells use complex transcriptional programs to alter their fate in response to specific stimuli is an important question in biology. For the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, we applied gene expression trajectory models to identify the genes involved in driving cell fate transitions. We modified trajectory models to account for the scenario where cells were exposed to different stimuli, in this case epidermal growth factor and heregulin, to arrive at different cell fates, i.e. proliferation and differentiation respectively. Using genome-wide CAGE time series data collected from the FANTOM5 consortium, we identified the sets of promoters that were involved in the transition of MCF-7 cells to their specific fates versus those with expression changes that were generic to both stimuli. Of the 1,552 promoters identified, 1,091 had stimulus-specific expression while 461 promoters had generic expression profiles over the time course surveyed. Many of these stimulus-specific promoters mapped to key regulators of the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) signaling pathway such as FHL2 (four and a half LIM domains 2). We observed that in general, generic promoters peaked in their expression early on in the time course, while stimulus-specific promoters tended to show activation of their expression at a later stage. The genes that mapped to stimulus-specific promoters were enriched for pathways that control focal adhesion, p53 signaling and MAPK signaling while generic promoters were enriched for cell death, transcription and the cell cycle. We identified 162 genes that were controlled by an alternative promoter during the time course where a subset of 37 genes had separate promoters that were classified as stimulus-specific and generic. The results of our study highlighted the degree of complexity involved in regulating a cell fate transition where multiple promoters mapping to the same gene can demonstrate quite divergent expression profiles.}},

Improving our understanding of these differences offers to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying sex-specific traits and diseases. However, to date, most studies have either ignored the X Chromosome or had insufficient power to test for the sex-specific impact of genetic variation. By analyzing whole blood transcriptomes of 922 individuals, we have conducted the first large-scale, genome-wide analysis of the impact of both sex and genetic variation on patterns of gene expression, including comparison between the X Chromosome and autosomes. We identified a depletion of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) on the X Chromosome, especially among genes under high selective constraint. In contrast, we discovered an enrichment of sex-specific regulatory variants on the X Chromosome. To resolve the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects, we generated chromatin accessibility data through ATAC-sequencing to connect sex-specific chromatin accessibility to sex-specific patterns of expression and regulatory variation. As sex-specific regulatory variants discovered in our study can inform sex differences in heritable disease prevalence, we integrated our data with genome-wide association study data for multiple immune traits identifying several traits with significant sex biases in genetic susceptibilities. Together, our study provides genome-wide insight into how genetic variation, the X Chromosome, and sex shape human gene regulation and disease.}},

Characterizing lncRNA expression across cells and tissues is key to understanding their role in determining phenotypes including human diseases. We present here FC-R2, a comprehensive expression atlas across a broadly defined human transcriptome, inclusive of over 109,000 coding and noncoding genes, as described in the FANTOM CAGE-Associated Transcriptome (FANTOM-CAT) study. This atlas greatly extends the gene annotation used in the original recount2 resource. We demonstrate the utility of the FC-R2 atlas by reproducing key findings from published large studies and by generating new results across normal and diseased human samples. In particular, we (a) identify tissue-specific transcription profiles for distinct classes of coding and noncoding genes, (b) perform differential expression analysis across thirteen cancer types, identifying novel noncoding genes potentially involved in tumor pathogenesis and progression, and (c) confirm the prognostic value for several enhancers lncRNAs expression in cancer. Our resource is instrumental for the systematic molecular characterization of lncRNA by the FANTOM6 Consortium. In conclusion, comprised of over 70,000 samples, the FC-R2 atlas will empower other researchers to investigate functions and biological roles of both known coding genes and novel lncRNAs.}},

  doi = {10.1101/gr.195602.115}, 
  abstract = {{As the fundamental units of chromatin, nucleosomes contribute to virtually all aspects of genome function. Common methods for mapping nucleosome positions rely on genome cleavage using micrococcal nuclease (MNase), or more recently, genetically-modified histones. Though deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) was used to probe the structure of nucleosomes in the 1960s and 70s, in the current high-throughput sequencing era, it has mainly been used to study genomic regions devoid of nucleosomes. Here, we reveal for the first time that DNase\textbackslashtextasciitildeI can be used to precisely map the (translational) positions of in vivo nucleosomes genome-wide. Specifically, exploiting a distinctive DNase\textbackslashtextasciitildeI cleavage profile within nucleosome-associated DNA---including a signature 10.3\textbackslashtextasciitildebp oscillation that corresponds to accessibility of the minor groove as DNA winds around the nucleosome---we develop a Bayes-factor--based method that can be used to map nucleosome positions along the genome. Compared to methods that require genetically-modified histones, our DNase-based approach is easily applied in any organism, which we demonstrate by producing maps in yeast and human. Compared to MNase-based methods that map nucleosomes based on cuts in linker regions, we utilize DNase I cuts both within and outside nucleosomal DNA and the oscillatory nature of the DNase I cleavage profile within nucleosomal DNA enables us to identify translational positioning details not apparent in MNase digestion of linker DNA. Because the oscillatory pattern corresponds to nucleosome rotational positioning, it also reveals the rotational context of transcription factor (TF) binding sites. We show that potential binding sites within nucleosome-associated DNA are often centered preferentially on an exposed major or minor groove. This preferential localization may modulate TF interaction with nucleosome-associated DNA as TFs search for binding sites.}},

Provided that appropriate statistical models correcting for population structure are included, this tool can be used in association analyses to provide high-resolution evaluation of multiple alleles. This study describes the population structure of the 302 lines, and investigates the relationship between population structure and various measures of phenotypic and breeding value. On average, our estimates of population structure account for 9.3\% of phenotypic variation, roughly equivalent to a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), with a high of 35\%.

Here, we report a large-scale study of the expression evolution of DNA-based functional gene duplicates in three major mammalian lineages (placental mammals, marsupials, egg-laying monotremes) and birds, on the basis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from nine species and eight organs. We observe dynamic changes in tissue expression preference of paralogs with different duplication ages, suggesting differential contribution of paralogs to specific organ functions during vertebrate evolution. Specifically, we show that paralogs that emerged in the common ancestor of bony vertebrates are enriched for genes with brain-specific expression and provide evidence for differential forces underlying the preferential emergence of young testis- and liver-specific expressed genes. Further analyses uncovered that the overall spatial expression profiles of gene families tend to be conserved, with several exceptions of pronounced tissue specificity shifts among lineage-specific gene family expansions. Finally, we trace new lineage-specific genes that may have contributed to the specific biology of mammalian organs, including the little-studied placenta. Overall, our study provides novel and taxonomically broad evidence for the differential contribution of duplicate genes to tissue-specific transcriptomes and for their importance for the phenotypic evolution of vertebrates.}},

Shared DNA sequence features adapt CGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state.

Reporter assays in transgenic mice show that the ICR contains a regulatory sequence that activates transcription during the development of the gastrointestinal system. Targeted deletion of the ICR in mice caused symptoms that recapitulated the human condition. Transcriptome analysis revealed that an unannotated open reading frame (Percc1) flanks the regulatory sequence, and the expression of this gene was lost in the developing gut of mice that lacked the ICR. Percc1-knockout mice displayed phenotypes similar to those observed upon ICR deletion in mice and patients, whereas an ICR-driven Percc1 transgene was sufficient to rescue the phenotypes found in mice that lacked the ICR. Together, our results identify a gene that is critical for intestinal function and underscore the need for targeted in vivo studies to interpret the growing number of clinical genetic findings that do not affect known protein-coding genes.}},

Our approach is based on the observation that two large classes of biophysical models for cis-regulatory mechanisms can be expressed as deep neural networks in which nodes and weights have explicit physiochemical interpretations. We also demonstrate how such biophysical networks can be rapidly learned, using modern deep learning frameworks, from the data produced by certain types of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). These results suggest a scalable strategy for using MPRAs to systematically characterize the biophysical basis of gene regulation in a wide range of biological contexts.

  abstract = {{It has often been argued that gene-duplication events are most commonly followed by a mutational event that silences one member of the pair, while on rare occasions both members of the pair are preserved as one acquires a mutation with a beneficial function and the other retains the original function. However, empirical evidence from genome duplication events suggests that gene duplicates are preserved in genomes far more commonly and for periods far in excess of the expectations under this model, and whereas some gene duplicates clearly evolve new functions, there is little evidence that this is the most common mechanism of duplicate-gene preservation. An alternative hypothesis is that gene duplicates are frequently preserved by subfunctionalization, whereby both members of a pair experience degenerative mutations that reduce their joint levels and patterns of activity to that of the single ancestral gene. We consider the ways in which the probability of duplicate-gene preservation by such complementary mutations is modified by aspects of gene structure, degree of linkage, mutation rates and effects, and population size. Even if most mutations cause complete loss-of-subfunction, the probability of duplicate-gene preservation can be appreciable if the long-term effective population size is on the order of 10(5) or smaller, especially if there are more than two independently mutable subfunctions per locus. Even a moderate incidence of partial loss-of-function mutations greatly elevates the probability of preservation. The model proposed herein leads to quantitative predictions that are consistent with observations on the frequency of long-term duplicate gene preservation and with observations that indicate that a common fate of the members of duplicate-gene pairs is the partitioning of tissue-specific patterns of expression of the ancestral gene.}},

These and other previously sequenced transcripts have been aligned with available genome sequences and have provided new insights into the characteristics of gene structures and promoters within this major crop species. We found that although the average number of introns per gene is about the same in corn and Arabidopsis, corn genes have more alternatively spliced isoforms. Examination of the nucleotide composition of coding regions reveals that corn genes, as well as genes of other Poaceae (Grass family), can be divided into two classes according to the GC content at the third position in the amino acid encoding codons. Many of the transcripts that have lower GC content at the third position have dicot homologs but the high GC content transcripts tend to be more specific to the grasses. The high GC content class is also enriched with intronless genes. Together this suggests that an identifiable class of genes in plants is associated with the Poaceae divergence. Furthermore, because many of these genes appear to be derived from ancestral genes that do not contain introns, this evolutionary divergence may be the result of horizontal gene transfer from species not only with different codon usage but possibly that did not have introns, perhaps outside of the plant kingdom. By comparing the cDNAs described herein with the non-redundant set of corn mRNAs in GenBank, we estimate that there are about 50,000 different protein coding genes in Zea.

Although several odorant binding protein (Obp) genes and olfactory receptor (Or) genes have been suggested to be associated with the D. sechellia host shift, a broad view of how chemosensory genes have contributed to this shift is still lacking. We therefore studied the transcriptomes of antennae, the main organ responsible for detecting food resource and oviposition, of D. sechellia and its two sibling species. We wanted to know whether gene expression, particularly chemosensory genes, has diverged between D. sechellia and its two sibling species. Using a very stringent definition of differential gene expression, we found a higher percentage of chemosensory genes differentially expressed in the D. sechellia lineage (7.8\%) than in the D. simulans lineage (5.4\%); for up-regulated chemosensory genes the percentages were 8.8\% in D. sechellia and 5.2\% in D. simulans. Interestingly, Obp50a exhibited the highest up-regulation, a \textbackslashtextasciitilde100 fold increase, and Or85c - previously reported to be a larva-specific gene - showed \textbackslashtextasciitilde20 fold up-regulation in D. sechellia. Furthermore, Ir84a (ionotropic receptor 84a), which has been proposed to be associated with male courtship behavior, was significantly up-regulated in D. sechellia. We also found expression divergence in most of the chemosensory gene families between D. sechellia and the two sibling species.

Here, we analyzed Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) profiles from activated primary CD4+ T cells of 105 healthy donors to identify ATAC-QTLs: genetic variants that affect chromatin accessibility. We found that ATAC-QTLs are widespread, disrupt binding sites for transcription factors known to be important for CD4+ T cell differentiation and activation, overlap and mediate expression QTLs from the same cells and are enriched for SNPs associated with autoimmune diseases. We also identified numerous pairs of ATAC-peaks with highly correlated chromatin accessibility. When we characterize 3D chromosome organization in primary CD4+ T cells by in situ-Hi-C, we found that correlated peaks tend to reside in the same chromatin contact domains, span super-enhancers, and are more impacted by ATAC-QTLs than single peaks. Thus, variability in chromatin accessibility in primary CD4+ T cells is heritable, is determined by genetic variation in a manner affected by the 3D organization of the genome, and mediates genetic effects on gene expression. Our results provide insights into how genetic variants modulate chromatin state and gene expression in primary immune cells that play a key role in many human diseases.}},

We carried out high-resolution genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic profiling in three major human immune cell types (CD14(+) monocytes, CD16(+) neutrophils, and naive CD4(+) T cells) from up to 197 individuals. We assess, quantitatively, the relative contribution of cis-genetic and epigenetic factors to transcription and evaluate their impact as potential sources of confounding in epigenome-wide association studies. Further, we characterize highly coordinated genetic effects on gene expression, methylation, and histone variation through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and allele-specific (AS) analyses. Finally, we demonstrate colocalization of molecular trait QTLs at 345 unique immune disease loci. This expansive, high-resolution atlas of multi-omics changes yields insights into cell-type-specific correlation between diverse genomic inputs, more generalizable correlations between these inputs, and defines molecular events that may underpin complex disease risk.}},

  abstract = {{Mediator is a large coregulator complex conserved from yeast to humans and involved in many human diseases, including cancers. Together with general transcription factors, it stimulates preinitiation complex (PIC) formation and activates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. In this study, we analyzed how Mediator acts in PIC assembly using in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches. We revealed an essential function of the Mediator middle module exerted through its Med10 subunit, implicating a key interaction between Mediator and TFIIB. We showed that this Mediator-TFIIB link has a global role on PIC assembly genome-wide. Moreover, the amplitude of Mediator's effect on PIC formation is gene-dependent and is related to the promoter architecture in terms of TATA elements, nucleosome occupancy, and dynamics. This study thus provides mechanistic insights into the coordinated function of Mediator and TFIIB in PIC assembly in different chromatin contexts.}},

We assess how well long-read or linked-read technologies resolve these regions. Based on standard whole-genome Illumina sequencing data, we identify 36,794 dark regions in 6054 gene bodies from pathways important to human health, development, and reproduction. Of these gene bodies, 8.7\% are completely dark and 35.2\% are ≥ 5\% dark. We identify dark regions that are present in protein-coding exons across 748 genes. Linked-read or long-read sequencing technologies from 10x Genomics, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies reduce dark protein-coding regions to approximately 50.5\%, 35.6\%, and 9.6\%, respectively. We present an algorithm to resolve most camouflaged regions and apply it to the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project. We rescue a rare ten-nucleotide frameshift deletion in CR1, a top Alzheimer’s disease gene, found in disease cases but not in controls. While we could not formally assess the association of the CR1 frameshift mutation with Alzheimer’s disease due to insufficient sample-size, we believe it merits investigating in a larger cohort.

We sequenced two cDNA libraries, one from the cells exponentially growing in a minimal medium and the other from meiotic cells. Both libraries were generated by using a vector-capping method that allows the accurate mapping of transcription start sites (TSSs). Consequently, we identified 11,575 TSSs associated with 3,638 annotated genomic features, including 3,599 ORFs, to suggest that most yeast genes have two or more TSSs. In addition, we identified 45 previously undescribed introns, including those affecting current ORF annotations and those spliced alternatively. Furthermore, the analysis revealed 667 transcription units in the intergenic regions and transcripts derived from antisense strands of 367 known features. We also found that 348 ORFs carry TSSs in their 3′-halves to generate sense transcripts starting from inside the ORFs. These results indicate that the budding yeast transcriptome is considerably more complex than previously thought, and it shares many recently revealed characteristics with the transcriptomes of mammals and other higher eukaryotes. Thus, the genome-wide active transcription that generates novel classes of transcripts appears to be an intrinsic feature of the eukaryotic cells. The budding yeast will serve as a versatile model for the studies on these aspects of transcriptome, and the full-length cDNA clones can function as an invaluable resource in such studies.}},

In prokaryotic cells, a single-input-module motif with one transcription factor regulating multiple target genes can generate coordinated gene expression. In eukaryotic cells, transcriptional activity of a gene is affected by not only transcription factors but also the epigenetic modifications and three-dimensional chromosome structure of the gene. To examine how local gene environment and transcription factor regulation are coupled, we performed a combined analysis of time-course RNA-seq data of TGF-\textbackslashb\{eta\} treated MCF10A cells and related epigenomic and Hi-C data. Using Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM), we clustered differentially expressed genes based on gene expression profiles and associated transcription factors. Genes in each class have similar temporal gene expression patterns and share common transcription factors. Next, we defined a set of linear and radial distribution functions, as used in statistical physics, to measure the distributions of genes within a class both spatially and linearly along the genomic sequence. Remarkably, genes within the same class despite sometimes being separated by tens of million bases (Mb) along genomic sequence show a significantly higher tendency to be spatially close despite sometimes being separated by tens of Mb along the genomic sequence than those belonging to different classes do. Analyses extended to the process of mouse nervous system development arrived at similar conclusions. Future studies will be able to test whether this spatial organization of chromosomes contributes to concerted gene expression.}},

Although some COFs have been shown to prefer certain promoter types2–5 over others (for example, see refs 6,7), the extent to which different COFs display intrinsic specificities for distinct promoters is unclear. Here we use a high-throughput promoter-activity assay in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells to screen 23 COFs for their ability to activate 72,000 candidate core promoters (CPs). We observe differential activation of CPs, indicating distinct regulatory preferences or ‘compatibilities’8,9 between COFs and specific types of CPs. These functionally distinct CP types are differentially enriched for known sequence elements2,4, such as the TATA box, downstream promoter element (DPE) or TCT motif, and display distinct chromatin properties at endogenous loci. Notably, the CP types differ in their relative abundance of H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 marks (see also refs 10–12), suggesting that these histone modifications might distinguish trans-regulatory factors rather than promoter- versus enhancer-type cis-regulatory elements. We confirm the existence of distinct COF–CP compatibilities in two additional Drosophila cell lines and in human cells, for which we find COFs that prefer TATA-box or CpG-island promoters, respectively. Distinct compatibilities between COFs and promoters can explain how different enhancers specifically activate distinct sets of genes9, alternative promoters within the same genes, and distinct transcription start sites within the same promoter13. Thus, COF–promoter compatibilities may underlie distinct transcriptional programs in species as divergent as flies and humans.}},

To address these questions, we analyzed ∼200,000 human TSSs by integrating evolutionary (inter- and intra-species) and functional genomic data, particularly focusing on evolutionarily young TSSs that emerged in the primate lineage. TSSs were grouped according to their evolutionary age using sequence alignment information as a proxy. Comparisons of young and old TSSs revealed that (1) new TSSs emerge through a combination of intrinsic factors, like the sequence properties of transposable elements and tandem repeats, and extrinsic factors such as their proximity to existing regulatory modules; (2) new TSSs undergo rapid evolution that reduces the inherent instability of repeat sequences associated with a high propensity of TSS emergence; and (3) once established, the transcriptional competence of surviving TSSs is gradually enhanced, with evolutionary changes subject to temporal (fewer regulatory changes in younger TSSs) and spatial constraints (fewer regulatory changes in more isolated TSSs). These findings advance our understanding of how regulatory innovations arise in the genome throughout evolution and highlight the genomic robustness and evolvability in these processes.}},

This prion, which we term [ESI +] for expressed sub-telomeric information, is triggered by transient Snt1 phosphorylation upon cell cycle arrest. Once engaged, the prion reshapes the activity of Snt1 and the Set3C complex, recruiting RNA pol II and interfering with Rap1 binding to activate genes in otherwise repressed sub-telomeric domains.

Therefore, comprehensively annotating promoters and deciphering their individual regulatory dynamics is critical for gene expression profiling applications and for our understanding of regulatory complexity. We introduce RAMPAGE, a novel promoter activity profiling approach that combines extremely specific 5'-complete cDNA sequencing with an integrated data analysis workflow, to address the limitations of current techniques. RAMPAGE features a streamlined protocol for fast and easy generation of highly multiplexed sequencing libraries, offers very high transcription start site specificity, generates accurate and reproducible promoter expression measurements, and yields extensive transcript connectivity information through paired-end cDNA sequencing. We used RAMPAGE in a genome-wide study of promoter activity throughout 36 stages of the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster, and describe here a comprehensive data set that represents the first available developmental time-course of promoter usage. We found that >40\% of developmentally expressed genes have at least two promoters and that alternative promoters generally implement distinct regulatory programs. Transposable elements, long proposed to play a central role in the evolution of their host genomes through their ability to regulate gene expression, contribute at least 1300 promoters shaping the developmental transcriptome of D. melanogaster. Hundreds of these promoters drive the expression of annotated genes, and transposons often impart their own expression specificity upon the genes they regulate. These observations provide support for the theory that transposons may drive regulatory innovation through the distribution of stereotyped cis-regulatory modules throughout their host genomes.}},

Here, we comprehensively assessed the interplay between genome topology and gene expression using highly rearranged chromosomes (balancers) spanning \textbackslashtextasciitilde75\% of the Drosophila genome. Using transheterozyte (balancer/wild-type) embryos, we measured allele-specific changes in topology and gene expression in cis, while minimizing trans effects. Through genome sequencing, we resolved eight large nested inversions, smaller inversions, duplications and thousands of deletions. These extensive rearrangements caused many changes to chromatin topology, disrupting long-range loops, topologically associating domains (TADs) and promoter interactions, yet these are not predictive of changes in expression. Gene expression is generally not altered around inversion breakpoints, indicating that mis-appropriate enhancer–promoter activation is a rare event. Similarly, shuffling or fusing TADs, changing intra-TAD connections and disrupting long-range inter-TAD loops does not alter expression for the majority of genes. Our results suggest that properties other than chromatin topology ensure productive enhancer–promoter interactions. Systematic analysis of highly rearranged balancer chromosomes in Drosophila shows that extensive changes to chromatin topology affect the expression of only a subset of genes.}},

Mapping of indels onto known protein structures demonstrated that structural cores are markedly less tolerant to indels than are loop regions.

Also noteworthy is the remarkable heterogeneity in the types of genetic alterations that likely drive the growth of pediatric cancers, including copy number alterations, gene fusions, enhancer hijacking events, and chromoplexy. Because most studies have genetically profiled pediatric cancers only at diagnosis, the mechanisms underlying tumor progression, therapy resistance, and metastasis remain poorly understood.

Expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs, are enriched for polymorphisms that have been found to be associated with disease risk. While most analyses of human data has focused on regulation of expression by nearby variants (cis-eQTLs), distal or trans-eQTLs may have broader effects on the transcriptome and important phenotypic consequences, necessitating a comprehensive study of the effects of genetic variants on distal gene transcription levels. In this work, we identify trans-eQTLs in the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project data, consisting of 449 individuals with RNA-sequencing data across 44 tissue types. We find 81 genes with a trans-eQTL in at least one tissue, and we demonstrate that trans-eQTLs are more likely than cis-eQTLs to have effects specific to a single tissue. We evaluate the genomic and functional properties of trans-eQTL variants, identifying strong enrichment in enhancer elements and Piwi-interacting RNA clusters. Finally, we describe three tissue-specific regulatory loci underlying relevant disease associations: 9q22 in thyroid that has a role in thyroid cancer, 5q31 in skeletal muscle, and a previously reported master regulator near KLF14 in adipose. These analyses provide a comprehensive characterization of trans-eQTLs across human tissues, which contribute to an improved understanding of the tissue-specific cellular mechanisms of regulatory genetic variation.}},

The authors highlight the diverse regulatory contributions of TEs to organismal physiology and pathology, provide a framework for responsibly assigning functional roles to TEs and offer visions for the future. Transposable elements (TEs) are a prolific source of tightly regulated, biochemically active non-coding elements, such as transcription factor-binding sites and non-coding RNAs. Many recent studies reinvigorate the idea that these elements are pervasively co-opted for the regulation of host genes. We argue that the inherent genetic properties of TEs and the conflicting relationships with their hosts facilitate their recruitment for regulatory functions in diverse genomes. We review recent findings supporting the long-standing hypothesis that the waves of TE invasions endured by organisms for eons have catalysed the evolution of gene-regulatory networks. We also discuss the challenges of dissecting and interpreting the phenotypic effect of regulatory activities encoded by TEs in health and disease.}},

Here, we show that expression of the rice gene Os8N3, a member of the MtN3 gene family from plants and animals, is elevated upon infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99(A) and depends on the type III effector gene pthXo1. Os8N3 resides near xa13, and PXO99(A) failed to induce Os8N3 in rice lines with xa13. Silencing of Os8N3 by inhibitory RNA produced plants that were resistant to infection by strain PXO99(A) yet remained susceptible to other strains of the pathogen. The effector gene avrXa7 from strain PXO86 enabled PXO99(A) compatibility on either xa13- or Os8N3-silenced plants. The findings indicate that Os8N3 is a host susceptibility gene for bacterial blight targeted by the type III effector PthXo1. The results support the hypothesis that X. oryzae pv. oryzae commandeers the regulation of otherwise developmentally regulated host genes to induce a state of disease susceptibility.

RESULTS:We developed cisASE, a likelihood-based method for detecting ASE on single nucleotide variant (SNV), exon and gene levels from sequencing data without requiring phasing or parental information. cisASE uses matched DNA-seq data to control technical bias and copy number variation (CNV) in putative cis-regulated ASE identification. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, cisASE exhibits significantly increased accuracy and speed. cisASE works moderately well for datasets without DNA-seq and thus is widely applicable. By applying cisASE to real datasets, we identified specific ASE characteristics in normal and cancer tissues, thus indicating that cisASE has potential for wide applications in cancer genomics.

Results We present SATORI, a S elf- AT tenti O n based model to predict R egulatory element I nteractions. Our approach combines convolutional and recurrent layers with a self-attention mechanism that helps us capture a global view of the landscape of interactions between regulatory elements in a sequence. We evaluate our method on simulated data and three complex datasets: human TAL1-GATA1 transcription factor ChIP-Seq, DNase I Hypersensitive Sites (DHSs) in human promoters across 164 cell lines, and genome-wide DNase I-Seq and ATAC-Seq peaks across 36 arabidopsis samples. In each of the three experiments SATORI identified numerous statistically significant TF interactions, many of which have been previously reported. Our approach not only provides a global, biologically relevant set of interactions but, unlike existing methods, it does not require a computationally expensive postprocessing step.

Comparisons with vertebrates identify an intermediate stage in the evolution of differentially methylated enhancers, and a high conservation of gene expression and its cis-regulatory logic between amphioxus and vertebrates that occurs maximally at an earlier mid-embryonic phylotypic period. We analyse regulatory evolution after whole-genome duplications, and find that—in vertebrates—over 80\% of broadly expressed gene families with multiple paralogues derived from whole-genome duplications have members that restricted their ancestral expression, and underwent specialization rather than subfunctionalization. Counter-intuitively, paralogues that restricted their expression increased the complexity of their regulatory landscapes.

Melé et al. measured how transcription varies among tissues, and Rivas et al. looked at how truncated protein variants affect expression across tissues. Science , this issue p. [648][1], p.

  doi = {10.1101/gr.189597.115}, 
  abstract = {{Human DIS3, the nuclear catalytic subunit of the exosome complex, contains exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic active domains. To identify DIS3 targets genome-wide, we combined comprehensive transcriptomic analyses of engineered HEK293 cells that expressed mutant DIS3, with Photoactivatable Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Cross-Linking and Immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) experiments. In cells expressing DIS3 with both catalytic sites mutated, RNAs originating from unannotated genomic regions increased ∼2.5-fold, covering ∼70\% of the genome and allowing for thousands of novel transcripts to be discovered. Previously described pervasive transcription products, such as Promoter Upstream Transcripts (PROMPTs), accumulated robustly upon DIS3 dysfunction, representing a significant fraction of PAR-CLIP reads. We have also detected relatively long putative premature RNA polymerase II termination products of protein-coding genes whose levels in DIS3 mutant cells can exceed the mature mRNAs, indicating that production of such truncated RNA is a common phenomenon. In addition, we found DIS3 to be involved in controlling the formation of paraspeckles, nuclear bodies that are organized around NEAT1 lncRNA, whose short form was overexpressed in cells with mutated DIS3. Moreover, the DIS3 mutations resulted in misregulation of expression of ∼50\% of transcribed protein-coding genes, probably as a secondary effect of accumulation of various noncoding RNA species. Finally, cells expressing mutant DIS3 accumulated snoRNA precursors, which correlated with a strong PAR-CLIP signal, indicating that DIS3 is the main snoRNA-processing enzyme. EXOSC10 (RRP6) instead controls the levels of the mature snoRNAs. Overall, we show that DIS3 has a major nucleoplasmic function in shaping the human RNA polymerase II transcriptome.}},

To address this gap, using liver and skin as a proof-of-concept tissues, we show that readily available signature genes based on expression profiles of mouse cell types can be used to deconvolute the cellular composition of human GTEx tissues. We then deconvoluted 6,829 bulk RNA-seq samples corresponding to 28 GTEx tissues and show that we are able to quantify cellular heterogeneity, determining both the different cell types present in each of the tissues and how their proportions vary between samples of the same tissue type. Conducting eQTL analyses for GTEx liver and skin samples using cell type composition estimates as interaction terms, we identified thousands of novel genetic associations that had lower effect sizes and were cell-type-associated. We further show that cell-type-associated eQTLs in skin colocalize with melanoma, malignant neoplasm, and infection signatures, indicating variants that influence gene expression in distinct skin cell types play important roles in skin traits and disease. Overall, our study provides a framework to estimate the relative fractions of different cell types in GTEx tissues using signature genes from mouse cell types and functionally characterize human genetic variation that impacts gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner.}},

Here, I review the origin and evolution of new genes and their functions in eukaryotes, an area of research that has made rapid progress in the past decade thanks to the genomics revolution. Indeed, recent work has provided initial whole-genome views of the different types of new genes for a large number of different organisms. The array of mechanisms underlying the origin of new genes is compelling, extending way beyond the traditionally well-studied source of gene duplication. Thus, it was shown that novel genes also regularly arose from messenger RNAs of ancestral genes, protein-coding genes metamorphosed into new RNA genes, genomic parasites were co-opted as new genes, and that both protein and RNA genes were composed from scratch (i.e., from previously nonfunctional sequences). These mechanisms then also contributed to the formation of numerous novel chimeric gene structures. Detailed functional investigations uncovered different evolutionary pathways that led to the emergence of novel functions from these newly minted sequences and, with respect to animals, attributed a potentially important role to one specific tissue--the testis--in the process of gene birth. Remarkably, these studies also demonstrated that novel genes of the various types significantly impacted the evolution of cellular, physiological, morphological, behavioral, and reproductive phenotypic traits. Consequently, it is now firmly established that new genes have indeed been major contributors to the origin of adaptive evolutionary novelties.}},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pgen.1008152}, 
  abstract = {{For many genes, proper gene expression requires coordinated and dynamic interactions between multiple regulatory elements, each of which can either promote or silence transcription. In Drosophila, the complexity of the regulatory landscape is further complicated by the tight physical pairing of homologous chromosomes, which can permit regulatory elements to interact in trans, a phenomenon known as transvection. To better understand how gene expression can be programmed through cis- and trans-regulatory interactions, we analyzed transvection effects for a collection of alleles of the eyes absent (eya) gene. We find that trans-activation of a promoter by the eya eye-specific enhancers is broadly supported in many allelic backgrounds, and that the availability of an enhancer to act in trans can be predicted based on the molecular lesion of an eya allele. Furthermore, by manipulating promoter availability in cis and in trans, we demonstrate that the eye-specific enhancers of eya show plasticity in their promoter preference between two different transcriptional start sites, which depends on promoter competition between the two potential targets. Finally, we show that certain alleles of eya demonstrate pairing-sensitive silencing resulting from trans-interactions between Polycomb Response Elements (PREs), and genetic and genomic data support a general role for PcG proteins in mediating transcriptional silencing at eya. Overall, our data highlight how eya gene regulation relies upon a complex but plastic interplay between multiple enhancers, promoters, and PREs.}},

The "branch-site" test is designed to detect localized episodic bouts of positive selection that affect only a few amino acid residues on particular lineages and has been shown to have reasonable power and low false-positive rates for a wide range of selection schemes. Previous simulations examining the performance of the test, however, were conducted under idealized conditions without insertions, deletions, or alignment errors. As the test is sometimes used to analyze divergent sequences, the impact of indels and alignment errors is a major concern. Here, we used a recently developed indel-simulation program to examine the false-positive rate and power of the branch-site test. We find that insertions and deletions do not cause excessive false positives if the alignment is correct, but alignment errors can lead to unacceptably high false positives. Of the alignment methods evaluated, PRANK consistently outperformed MUSCLE, MAFFT, and ClustalW, mostly because the latter programs tend to place nonhomologous codons (or amino acids) into the same column, producing shorter and less accurate alignments and giving the false impression that many amino acid substitutions have occurred at those sites. Our examination of two previous studies suggests that alignment errors may impact the analysis of mammalian and vertebrate genes by the branch-site test, and it is important to use reliable alignment methods.}},

We found that single genetic variants frequently affect binding of multiple TFs, and CTCF can recruit all five TFs to its binding sites. These QTLs often affect local chromatin and transcription but can also influence long-range chromosomal contacts, demonstrating a role for natural genetic variation in chromosomal architecture.

At many genes, Pol II pauses stably in early elongation, remaining engaged with the 25-60 nucleotide-long nascent RNA for many minutes while awaiting signals for release into the gene body. However, a number of genes display highly unstable promoter Pol II, suggesting that paused polymerase might dissociate from template DNA at these promoters and release a short, non-productive mRNA. Here, we report that paused Pol II can be actively destabilized by the Integrator complex. Specifically, Integrator utilizes its RNA endonuclease activity to cleave nascent RNA and drive termination of paused Pol II. These findings uncover a previously unappreciated mechanism of metazoan gene repression, akin to bacterial transcription attenuation, wherein promoter-proximal Pol II is prevented from entering productive elongation through factor-regulated termination.</p>}},

Recently, ideas have emerged that the epigenetic state of the sperm nucleus could influence transcription in the embryo. However conflicting reports have challenged the existence of epigenetic marking of sperm genes, and there are no functional tests supporting the role of sperm epigenetic marking on embryonic gene expression. Here we show that sperm is epigenetically programmed to regulate embryonic gene expression. By comparing the development of sperm- and spermatid-derived frog embryos we show that the programming of sperm for successful development relates to its ability to regulate transcription of a set of developmentally important genes. During spermatid maturation into sperm, these genes lose H3K4me2/3 and retain H3K27me3 marks. Experimental removal of these epigenetic marks, at fertilization, deregulates gene expression in the resulting embryos in a paternal chromatin dependent manner. This demonstrates that epigenetic instructions delivered by the sperm at fertilization are required for correct regulation of gene expression in the future embryos. The epigenetic mechanisms of developmental programming revealed here are likely to relate to the mechanisms involved in transgenerational transmission of acquired traits. Understanding how parental experience can influence development of the progeny has broad potential for improving human health.}},

Genotype and monocyte gene expression were available in individuals with African American (AFA, n=233), Hispanic (HIS, n=352), and European (CAU, n=578) ancestry. We performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping in each population and show genetic correlation of gene expression depends on shared ancestry proportions. Using elastic net modeling with cross validation to optimize genotypic predictors of gene expression in each population, we show the genetic architecture of gene expression for most predictable genes is sparse. We found the best predicted gene, <i>TACSTD2</i>, was the same across populations with R<sup>2</sup> \&gt; 0.86 in each population. However, we identified a subset of genes that are well-predicted in one population, but poorly predicted in another. We show these differences in predictive performance are due to allele frequency differences between populations. Using genotype weights trained in MESA to predict gene expression in independent populations showed that a training set with ancestry similar to the test set is better at predicting gene expression in test populations, demonstrating an urgent need for diverse population sampling in genomics.

These results demonstrate that the apparent genetic complexity of the agouti locus is explained by the existence of multiple regulatory elements exerting control over a single coding sequence and provide a conceptual basis for understanding differences in dorsal and ventral hair coloration in many mammalian species.

We find that local h2 can be relatively well characterized with 59\% of expressed genes showing significant h2 (FDR < 0.1) in the DGN whole blood cohort. However, current sample sizes (n ≤ 922) do not allow us to compute distal h2. Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model (BSLMM) analysis provides strong evidence that the genetic contribution to local expression traits is dominated by a handful of genetic variants rather than by the collective contribution of a large number of variants each of modest size. In other words, the local architecture of gene expression traits is sparse rather than polygenic across all 40 tissues (from DGN and GTEx) examined. This result is confirmed by the sparsity of optimal performing gene expression predictors via elastic net modeling. To further explore the tissue context specificity, we decompose the expression traits into cross-tissue and tissue-specific components using a novel Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition (OTD) approach. Through a series of simulations we show that the cross-tissue and tissue-specific components are identifiable via OTD. Heritability and sparsity estimates of these derived expression phenotypes show similar characteristics to the original traits. Consistent properties relative to prior GTEx multi-tissue analysis results suggest that these traits reflect the expected biology. Finally, we apply this knowledge to develop prediction models of gene expression traits for all tissues. The prediction models, heritability, and prediction performance R2 for original and decomposed expression phenotypes are made publicly available (https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan).}},

We hypothesize that brain-expressed chimeras may contribute to schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia and control individuals were screened genome wide for copy-number variants (CNVs) that disrupted two genes on the same DNA strand. Candidate events were filtered for predicted brain expression and for frequency < 0.001 in an independent series of 20,000 controls. Four of 124 affected individuals and zero of 290 control individuals harbored such events (p = 0.002); a 47 kb duplication disrupted MATK and ZFR2, a 58 kb duplication disrupted PLEKHD1 and SLC39A9, a 121 kb duplication disrupted DNAJA2 and NETO2, and a 150 kb deletion disrupted MAP3K3 and DDX42. Each fusion produced a stable protein when exogenously expressed in cultured cells. We examined whether these chimeras differed from their parent genes in localization, regulation, or function. Subcellular localizations of DNAJA2-NETO2 and MAP3K3-DDX42 differed from their parent genes. On the basis of the expression profile of the MATK promoter, MATK-ZFR2 is likely to be far more highly expressed in the brain during development than the ZFR2 parent gene. MATK-ZFR2 includes a ZFR2-derived isoform that we demonstrate localizes preferentially to neuronal dendritic branch sites. These results suggest that the formation of chimeric genes is a mechanism by which CNVs contribute to schizophrenia and that, by interfering with parent gene function, chimeras may disrupt critical brain processes, including neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and dendritic arborization.}},

To explore the genetic basis for these differences, we developed a comparative genomics approach to scan whole-genome multiple sequence alignments to identify regions that evolved rapidly in an ancestral lineage but are conserved within extant species. This pattern suggests that ancestral changes in function were maintained in descendants. After applying this test to therian mammals, we identified 4797 accelerated regions, many of which are non-coding and located near developmental transcription factors. We then used mouse transgenic reporter assays to test if non-coding accelerated regions are enhancers and to determine how therian-specific substitutions affect their activity in vivo. We discovered enhancers with expression specific to the therian version in brain regions involved in the hormonal control of milk ejection, uterine contractions, blood pressure, temperature, and visual processing. This work underscores the idea that changes in developmental gene expression are important for mammalian evolution, and it pinpoints candidate genes for unique aspects of mammalian biology.}},

However, the effects of these epigenetic changes on the structure and function of chromatin domains have not been explored. Here, we found a functional interplay between TADs and epigenetic and transcriptional changes mediated by mutated EZH2. Altered EZH2 (p.Tyr646* (EZH2Y646X)) led to silencing of entire domains, synergistically inactivating multiple tumor suppressors. Intra-TAD gene silencing was coupled with changes of interactions between gene promoter regions. Notably, gene expression and chromatin interactions were restored by pharmacological inhibition of EZH2Y646X. Our results indicate that EZH2Y646X alters the topology and function of chromatin domains to promote synergistic oncogenic programs.}},

In this study, We have prepared a unique set of time-course data for the developing cerebellum, as part of the FANTOM5 consortium (http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/) that uses their innovative capturing of 5′ ends of all transcripts followed by Helicos next generation sequencing. We analyzed the usage of all transcription start sites (TSSs) at each time point during cerebellar development that provided information on multiple RNA isoforms that emerged from the same gene. We developed a mathematical method that systematically compares the expression of different TSSs of a gene to identify temporal crossover and non-crossover switching events. We identified 48,489 novel TSS switching events in 5433 genes during cerebellar development. This includes 9767 crossover TSS switching events in 1511 genes, where the dominant TSS shifts over time. We observed a relatively high prevalence of TSS switching in cerebellar development where the resulting temporally-specific gene transcripts and protein products can play important regulatory and functional roles.}},

We also know that functional differences between duplicate genes can originate in several different ways, including mutations that directly impart new functions, subdivision of ancestral functions and selection for changes in gene dosage.

  abstract = {{<p>Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous schizophrenia (SZ) associated loci. As is common across disorders, many of the SZ associated variants are located outside protein-coding regions and are hypothesized to differentially affect the transcription of nearby genes. To systematically identify which variants affect potential regulatory activity, we assayed all 1049 variants in high Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) within 64 reported SZ-associated loci and an additional 30 SNPs from 9 loci associated with Alzheimer9s disease (AD) using a massively parallel re- porter assay (MPRA). Each variant was assayed on the center of a 95bp synthetic oligonucleotide. The resulting library was transfected 3 independent times into K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia lymphoblasts and another 6 times into SK-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. We identified 148 SNPs with significant allelic differences in their effect on expression of the reporter gene in the K562 cells and 53 in the SK-SY5Y cells with an average of 2.6 such SNPs per locus and a median of 1. The overlap between cell lines was modest with 9 SNPs having significant allelic differences in both lines, 8 of these 9 in the same direction. We do not observe a direction preference (increased or decreased enhancer activity) for risk vs. non risk alleles. We find that large LD blocks have a greater density of functional SNPs supporting instances of combinatorial SNP effects that may lead to selection at the haplotype level. Our results help determine driver GWAS variant(s), guide the functional follow up of disease associated loci and enhance our understanding of the genomic dynamics of gene regulation.</p>}},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Transcription initiation is a key component in the regulation of gene expression. mRNA 5' full-length sequencing techniques have enhanced our understanding of mammalian transcription start sites (TSSs), revealing different initiation patterns on a genomic scale.

RESULTS:To identify TSSs in Drosophila melanogaster, we applied a hierarchical clustering strategy on available 5' expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and identified a high quality set of 5,665 TSSs for approximately 4,000 genes. We distinguished two initiation patterns: 'peaked' TSSs, and 'broad' TSS cluster groups. Peaked promoters were found to contain location-specific sequence elements; conversely, broad promoters were associated with non-location-specific elements. In alignments across other Drosophila genomes, conservation levels of sequence elements exceeded 90\% within the melanogaster subgroup, but dropped considerably for distal species. Elements in broad promoters had lower levels of conservation than those in peaked promoters. When characterizing the distributions of ESTs, 64\% of TSSs showed distinct associations to one out of eight different spatiotemporal conditions. Available whole-genome tiling array time series data revealed different temporal patterns of embryonic activity across the majority of genes with distinct alternative promoters. Many genes with maternally inherited transcripts were found to have alternative promoters utilized later in development. Core promoters of maternally inherited transcripts showed differences in motif composition compared to zygotically active promoters.

CONCLUSIONS:Our study provides a comprehensive map of Drosophila TSSs and the conditions under which they are utilized. Distinct differences in motif associations with initiation pattern and spatiotemporal utilization illustrate the complex regulatory code of transcription initiation.}},

  abstract = {{<p>Background. Gene regulatory variation has been proposed to play an important role in the adaptation of plants to environmental stress. In the central highlands of Mexico, farmer selection has generated a unique group of maize landraces adapted the challenges of the highland niche. In this study, gene expression in Mexican highland maize and a reference maize breeding line were compared to identify evidence of regulatory variation in stress-related genes. It was hypothesised that local adaptation in Mexican highland maize would be associated with a transcriptional signature observable even under benign conditions. Methods. Allele specific expression analysis was performed using the seedling-leaf transcriptome of an F1 individual generated from the cross between the highland adapted Mexican landrace Palomero Toluqueño and the reference line B73, grown under benign conditions. Results were compared with a published dataset describing the transcriptional response of B73 seedlings to cold, heat, salt and UV treatments. Results. A total of 2386 genes were identified to show allele specific expression. Of these, 277 showed an expression difference between Palomero Toluqueño and B73 alleles that mirrored the response of B73 cold, heat, salt and/or UV treatments, and, as such, were considered to display a constitutive stress response. Constitutive stress response candidates included genes associated with plant hormone signaling and a number of transcription factors. Construction of a gene co-expression network revealed further signaling and stress-related genes to be among the potential targets of the transcription factors candidates. Discussion. Constitutive activation of responses may represent the best strategy when stresses are severe but predictable. Expression differences observed here between Palomero Toluqueño and B73 alleles indicate the presence of cis-acting regulatory variation linked to stress-related genes in Palomero Toluqueño. Considered alongside gene annotation and population data, allele specific expression analysis of plants grown under benign conditions provides an attractive strategy to identify functional variation potentially linked to local adaptation.</p>}},

It is unclear, for example, to what extent selection, rather than neutral genetic drift, drives the fixation and early evolution of duplicate loci. Analysis of recently duplicated genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome reveals significantly reduced species-wide levels of nucleotide polymorphisms in the progenitor and/or duplicate gene copies, suggesting that selective sweeps accompany the initial stages of the evolution of these duplicated gene pairs.

  abstract = {{The molecular process of transcription by RNA Polymerase II is highly conserved among eukaryotes ("classic model"). Intriguingly, a distinct way of locating transcription start sites (TSSs) was found in a budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ("scanning model"). The origin of the "scanning model" and its underlying genetic mechanisms remain unsolved. Herein, we applied genomic approaches to address these questions. We first identified TSSs at a single-nucleotide resolution for 12 yeast species using the nAnT-iCAGE technique, which significantly improved the annotations of these genomes by providing accurate 5′-boundaries of protein-coding genes. We then infer the initiation mechanism of a species based on its TSS maps and genome sequences. We found that the "scanning model" had originated after the split of Yarrowia lipolytica and the rest of budding yeasts. An adenine-rich region immediately upstream of TSS had appeared during the evolution of the "scanning model" species, which might facilitate TSS selection in these species. Both initiation mechanisms share a strong preference for pyrimidine-purine dinucleotides surrounding the TSS. Our results suggested that the purine is required for accurately recruiting the first nucleotide, increasing the chance of being capped during mRNA maturation, which is critical for efficient translation initiation. Based on our findings, we proposed a model of TSS selection for the "scanning model" species. Besides, our study also demonstrated that the intrinsic sequence feature primarily determines the distribution of initiation activities within a core promoter (core promoter shape).}},

Moreover, we observe a 10bp periodicity in the optimal distance between the TATA and the Inr. By comprehensively screening TF binding-sites, we show that site orientation has little effect, that the effect of binding site number on expression is factor-specific, and that there is a striking agreement between the effect of binding site multiplicity and TF appearance in endogenous homotypic clusters.

Here, we present a strategy for high-resolution nucleosome profiling at selected genomic features, and use this to analyse dynamic nucleosome positioning at inducible and cell-type-specific mammalian promoters. We find that nucleosome patterning at inducible promoters frequently resembles that at active promoters, even before stimulus-driven activation. Accordingly, the nucleosome profile at many inactive inducible promoters is sufficient to predict cell-type-specific responsiveness. Induction of gene expression is generally not associated with major changes to nucleosome patterning, and a subset of inducible promoters can be activated without stable nucleosome depletion from their transcription start sites. These promoters are generally dependent on remodelling enzymes for their inducible activation, and exhibit transient nucleosome depletion only at alleles undergoing transcription initiation. Together, these data reveal how the responsiveness of inducible promoters to activating stimuli is linked to cell-type-specific nucleosome patterning. Nucleosome organisation plays important roles in regulating functional genomic elements. Here, the authors use high-resolution profiling to analyse dynamic nucleosome positioning at inducible and cell-type-specific promoters, providing a global view of chromatin architecture at inducible promoters.}},

  abstract = {{The evolutionary origin of the striking genome size variations found in eukaryotes remains enigmatic. The effective size of populations, by controlling selection efficacy, is expected to be a key parameter underlying genome size evolution. However, this hypothesis has proved difficult to investigate using empirical data sets. Here, we tested this hypothesis using 22 de novo transcriptomes and low-coverage genomes of asellid isopods, which represent 11 independent habitat shifts from surface water to resource-poor groundwater. We show that these habitat shifts are associated with higher transcriptome-wide dN/dS After ruling out the role of positive selection and pseudogenization, we show that these transcriptome-wide dN/dS increases are the consequence of a reduction in selection efficacy imposed by the smaller effective population size of subterranean species. This reduction is paralleled by an important increase in genome size (25\% increase on average), an increase also confirmed in subterranean decapods and mollusks. We also control for an adaptive impact of genome size on life history traits but find no correlation between body size, or growth rate, and genome size. We show instead that the independent increases in genome size measured in subterranean isopods are the direct consequence of increasing invasion rates by repeat elements, which are less efficiently purged out by purifying selection. Contrary to selection efficacy, polymorphism is not correlated to genome size. We propose that recent demographic fluctuations and the difficulty of observing polymorphism variation in polymorphism-poor species can obfuscate the link between effective population size and genome size when polymorphism data are used alone.}},

In addition to substitutions, evolutionary events such as gene duplication and loss (as well as horizontal transfer) play a major role in gene evolution, and many phylogenetic models have been developed in order to reconstruct and study these events. However, these models typically make the simplifying assumption that population-related effects such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) are negligible. While this assumption may have been reasonable in some settings, it has become increasingly problematic as increased genome sequencing has led to denser phylogenies, where effects such as ILS are more prominent. To address this challenge, we present a new probabilistic model, DLCoal, that defines gene duplication and loss in a population setting, such that coalescence and ILS can be directly addressed. Interestingly, this model implies that in addition to the usual gene tree and species tree, there exists a third tree, the locus tree, which will likely have many applications. Using this model, we develop the first general reconciliation method that accurately infers gene duplications and losses in the presence of ILS, and we show its improved inference of orthologs, paralogs, duplications, and losses for a variety of clades, including flies, fungi, and primates. Also, our simulations show that gene duplications increase the frequency of ILS, further illustrating the importance of a joint model. Going forward, we believe that this unified model can offer insights to questions in both phylogenetics and population genetics.}},

Computationally predicting these binding sites can help the biological community in understanding the nucleic acid binding proteins in the very first step. The emergence of nucleic acid binding site prediction programs and web servers during the last decade shows a great diversity in various aspects. Besides, some binding site prediction related questions, such as i) can RNA binding sites be distinguished from DNA binding sites? ii) can RNA and DNA binding sites be predicted in the same model?, have not been fully answered. Here, we benchmarked 19 web servers and 3 stand-alone programs on 41 previously reported data sets and analyzed the prediction results in different aspects to show a more complete view of how well these programs can perform and how they can be used. We hope to demonstrate some key points for unbiased comparison for further development of similar prediction programs.}},

Here we propose a new k-mer occurrence model to reflect the fact that functional DNA k-mers often cluster around ChIP peak summits. With this model, we introduced a new measure to discover functional k-mers. Using simulation, we demonstrated that our method is more robust against noises in ChIP data than available methods. A novel word clustering method is also implemented to group similar k-mers into position weight matrices (PWMs). Our method was applied to a diverse set of ChIP experiments to demonstrate its high sensitivity and specificity. Importantly, our method is much faster than several other methods for large sample sizes. Thus, we have developed an efficient and effective motif discovery method for ChIP experiments.}},

These important modes of gene regulation often vary across cell types, and can contribute to the diversification of transcriptomes and thus cellular differentiation. Therefore, the identification of primary and processed 5' ends of RNAs is important for their functional characterization. Methods have been developed to profile either RNA 5' ends from primary transcripts or the products of RNA degradation genome-wide. However, these approaches either require high amounts of starting RNA or are performed in the absence of paired gene-body mRNA-seq data. This limits current efforts in RNA 5' end annotation to whole tissues and can prevent accurate RNA 5' end classification due to biases in the datasets. To enable the accurate identification and precise classification of RNA 5' ends from standard and low-input RNA, we developed a next-generation sequencing based method called nanoPARE and associated software. By integrating RNA 5' end information from nanoPARE with gene-body mRNA-seq data from the same RNA sample, our method enables the identification of transcription start sites at single-nucleotide resolution from single-cell levels of total RNA, as well as small RNA-mediated cleavage events from at least 10,000-fold less total RNA compared to conventional approaches. NanoPARE can therefore be used to accurately profile transcription start sites, noncapped RNA 5' ends and small RNA targeting events from individual tissue types. As a proof-of-principle, we utilized nanoPARE to improve Arabidopsis thalianaRNA 5' end annotations and quantify microRNA-mediated cleavage events across five different flower tissues.}},

Pan-cancer analyses reveal that oncogenes encoded on ecDNA are among the most highly expressed genes in the transcriptome of the tumours, linking increased copy number with high transcription levels. Quantitative assessment of the chromatin state reveals that although ecDNA is packaged into chromatin with intact domain structure, it lacks higher-order compaction that is typical of chromosomes and displays significantly enhanced chromatin accessibility. Furthermore, ecDNA is shown to have a significantly greater number of ultra-long-range interactions with active chromatin, which provides insight into how the structure of circular ecDNA affects oncogene function, and connects ecDNA biology with modern cancer genomics and epigenetics. Imaging and sequencing approaches are combined to show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer is circular and has unique chromatin structure that amplifies oncogene output.}},

With 30,969 well-defined TSSs from mouse and 26,341 from human, there are sufficient numbers to draw statistically meaningful conclusions and to consider differences between promoter types. Unlike previous smaller studies, we have considered the effects of insertions, deletions, and transposable elements as well as nucleotide substitutions. The rate of promoter evolution relative to that of control sequences has not been consistent between lineages nor within lineages over time. The most pronounced manifestation of this heterotachy is the increased rate of evolution in primate promoters. This increase is seen across different classes of mutation, including substitutions and micro-indel events. We investigated the relationship between promoter and coding sequence selective constraint and suggest that they are generally uncorrelated. This analysis also identified a small number of mouse promoters associated with the immune response that are under positive selection in rodents. We demonstrate significant differences in divergence between functional promoter categories and identify a category of promoters, not associated with conventional protein-coding genes, that has the highest rates of divergence across mammals. We find that evolutionary rates vary both on a fine scale within mammalian promoters and also between different functional classes of promoters. The discovery of heterotachy in promoter evolution, in particular the accelerated evolution of primate promoters, has important implications for our understanding of human evolution and for strategies to detect primate-specific regulatory elements.}},

Deletion of the 25-kb Lockd locus reduced Cdkn1b transcription by approximately 70\% in an erythroid cell line. In contrast, homozygous insertion of a polyadenylation cassette 80 bp downstream of the Lockd transcription start site reduced the entire lncRNA transcript level by >90\% with no effect on Cdkn1b transcription. The Lockd promoter contains a DNase-hypersensitive site, binds numerous transcription factors, and physically associates with the Cdkn1b promoter in chromosomal conformation capture studies. Therefore, the Lockd gene positively regulates Cdkn1b transcription through an enhancer-like cis element, whereas the lncRNA itself is dispensable, which may be the case for other lncRNAs.}},

Rev-Erbs function as transcriptional repressors by recruiting nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR)-HDAC3 complexes to Rev-Erb response elements in enhancers and promoters of target genes, but the molecular basis for cell-specific programs of repression is not known. Here we present evidence that in mouse macrophages Rev-Erbs regulate target gene expression by inhibiting the functions of distal enhancers that are selected by macrophage-lineage-determining factors, thereby establishing a macrophage-specific program of repression. Remarkably, the repressive functions of Rev-Erbs are associated with their ability to inhibit the transcription of enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs). Furthermore, targeted degradation of eRNAs at two enhancers subject to negative regulation by Rev-Erbs resulted in reduced expression of nearby messenger RNAs, suggesting a direct role of these eRNAs in enhancer function. By precisely defining eRNA start sites using a modified form of global run-on sequencing that quantifies nascent 5' ends, we show that transfer of full enhancer activity to a target promoter requires both the sequences mediating transcription-factor binding and the specific sequences encoding the eRNA transcript. These studies provide evidence for a direct role of eRNAs in contributing to enhancer functions and suggest that Rev-Erbs act to suppress gene expression at a distance by repressing eRNA transcription.}},

Here we used allele-sensitive single-cell RNA-seq on clonal primary mouse fibroblasts and freshly isolated human CD8(+) T cells to dissect clonal and dynamic monoallelic expression patterns. Dynamic aRME affected a considerable portion of the cells' transcriptomes, with levels dependent on the cells' transcriptional activity. Notably, clonal aRME was detected, but it was surprisingly scarce (<1\% of genes) and mainly affected the most weakly expressed genes. Consequently, the overwhelming majority of aRME occurs transiently within individual cells, and patterns of aRME are thus primarily scattered throughout somatic cell populations rather than, as previously hypothesized, confined to patches of clonally related cells.}},

TFIID binds core promoter DNA elements and directs the assembly of other general transcription factors, leading to binding of RNA polymerase II and activation of RNA synthesis. How TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and the TBP-associated factors (TAFs) are assembled into a functional TFIID complex with promoter recognition and coactivator activities in vivo remains unknown. Here, we use RNAi to knock down specific TFIID subunits in Drosophila tissue culture cells to determine which subunits are most critical for maintaining stability of TFIID in vivo. Contrary to expectations, we find that TAF4 rather than TBP or TAF1 plays the most critical role in maintaining stability of the complex. Our analysis also indicates that TAF5, TAF6, TAF9, and TAF12 play key roles in stability of the complex, whereas TBP, TAF1, TAF2, and TAF11 contribute very little to complex stability. Based on our results, we propose that holo-TFIID comprises a stable core subcomplex containing TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF9, and TAF12 decorated with peripheral subunits TAF1, TAF2, TAF11, and TBP. Our initial functional studies indicate a specific and significant role for TAF1 and TAF4 in mediating transcription from a TATA-less, downstream core promoter element (DPE)-containing promoter, whereas a TATA-containing, DPE-less promoter was far less dependent on these subunits. In contrast to both TAF1 and TAF4, RNAi knockdown of TAF5 had little effect on transcription from either class of promoter.

  abstract = {{In humans, the adaptive immune system uses the exchange of information between cells to detect and eliminate foreign or damaged cells; however, the removal of unwanted cells does not always require an adaptive immune system1,2. For example, cell selection in Drosophila uses a cell selection mechanism based on ‘fitness fingerprints’, which allow it to delay ageing3, prevent developmental malformations3,4 and replace old tissues during regeneration5. At the molecular level, these fitness fingerprints consist of combinations of Flower membrane proteins3,4,6. Proteins that indicate reduced fitness are called Flower-Lose, because they are expressed in cells marked to be eliminated6. However, the presence of Flower-Lose isoforms at a cell’s membrane does not always lead to elimination, because if neighbouring cells have similar levels of Lose proteins, the cell will not be killed4,6,7. Humans could benefit from the capability to recognize unfit cells, because accumulation of damaged but viable cells during development and ageing causes organ dysfunction and disease8–17. However, in Drosophila this mechanism is hijacked by premalignant cells to gain a competitive growth advantage18. This would be undesirable for humans because it might make tumours more aggressive19–21. It is unknown whether a similar mechanism of cell-fitness comparison is present in humans. Here we show that two human Flower isoforms (hFWE1 and hFWE3) behave as Flower-Lose proteins, whereas the other two isoforms (hFWE2 and hFWE4) behave as Flower-Win proteins. The latter give cells a competitive advantage over cells expressing Lose isoforms, but Lose-expressing cells are not eliminated if their neighbours express similar levels of Lose isoforms; these proteins therefore act as fitness fingerprints. Moreover, human cancer cells show increased Win isoform expression and proliferate in the presence of Lose-expressing stroma, which confers a competitive growth advantage on the cancer cells. Inhibition of the expression of Flower proteins reduces tumour growth and metastasis, and induces sensitivity to chemotherapy. Our results show that ancient mechanisms of cell recognition and selection are active in humans and affect oncogenic growth.}},

The most frequent pattern in invertebrate animals, however, is mosaic methylation, comprising domains of methylated DNA interspersed with unmethylated domains. To understand the origin of mosaic DNA methylation patterns, we examined the distribution of DNA methylation in the Ciona intestinalis genome. Bisulfite sequencing and computational analysis revealed methylated domains with sharp boundaries that strongly colocalize with approximately 60\% of transcription units. By contrast, promoters, intergenic DNA, and transposons are not preferentially targeted by DNA methylation. Methylated transcription units include evolutionarily conserved genes, whereas the most highly expressed genes preferentially belong to the unmethylated fraction.

We found that ERVs have shaped the evolution of a transcriptional network underlying the interferon (IFN) response, a major branch of innate immunity, and that lineage-specific ERVs have dispersed numerous IFN-inducible enhancers independently in diverse mammalian genomes. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of a subset of these ERV elements in the human genome impaired expression of adjacent IFN-induced genes and revealed their involvement in the regulation of essential immune functions, including activation of the AIM2 inflammasome. Although these regulatory sequences likely arose in ancient viruses, they now constitute a dynamic reservoir of IFN-inducible enhancers fueling genetic innovation in mammalian immune defenses.}},

To understand the relationship between motif syntax and transcription factor binding, we train a deep learning model that uses DNA sequence to predict base-resolution binding profiles of four pluripotency transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Klf4. We interpret the model to accurately map hundreds of thousands of motifs in the genome, learn novel motif representations and identify rules by which motifs and syntax influence transcription factor binding. We find that instances of strict motif spacing are largely due to retrotransposons, but that soft motif syntax influences motif interactions at protein and nucleosome range. Most strikingly, Nanog binding is driven by motifs with a strong preference for \textbackslashtextasciitilde10.5 bp spacings corresponding to helical periodicity. Interpreting deep learning models applied to high-resolution binding data is a powerful and versatile approach to uncover the motifs and syntax of cis-regulatory sequences.</p>}},

In this study the large scale identification and pathway enrichment analysis for bidirectional genes were performed in several eukaryotes and the comparative analysis of this arrangement between human and mouse were dissected for the purpose of discovering the driving force of the preservation of this genomic structure. We identified the bidirectional gene pairs in eight different species and found this structure to be prevalent in eukaryotes. The pathway enrichment analysis indicated the bidirectional genes at the genome level are conserved in certain pathways, such as the DNA repair and some other fundamental cellular pathways. The comparative analysis about the gene expression, function, between human and mouse bidirectional genes were also performed and we observed that the selective force of this architecture doesn't derive from the co-regulation between paired genes, but the functional bias of bidirectional genes at whole genome level is observed strengthened during evolution. Our result validated the coexpression of bidirectional genes; however failed to support their functional relevance. The conservation of bidirectional promoters seems not the result of functional connection between paired genes, but the functional bias at whole genome level, which imply that the genome-wide functional constraint is important for the conservation of bidirectional structure.}},

We show that expression levels of many critical growth regulators such as Wnt and TGFβ pathway components significantly differ between sexes but not between lines exhibiting size differences within each sex, suggesting a primary role of these regulators in sexual size dimorphism. Only a few growth genes including a receptor of steroid hormone ecdysone exhibit association with between-line size differences. In contrast, we find that between-line size variation is largely regulated by genes with a diverse range of cellular functions, most of which have never been implicated in growth. In addition, we show that expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) linked to these novel growth regulators accurately predict population-wide, between-line wing size variation.

Yet, an unresolved caveat of the iPSC model system is the extent to which reprogrammed iPSCs retain residual phenotypes from their precursor somatic cells. To directly address this issue, we used an effective study design to compare regulatory phenotypes between iPSCs derived from two types of commonly used somatic precursor cells. We find a remarkably small number of differences in DNA methylation and gene expression levels between iPSCs derived from different somatic precursors. Instead, we demonstrate genetic variation is associated with the majority of identifiable variation in DNA methylation and gene expression levels. We show that the cell type of origin only minimally affects gene expression levels and DNA methylation in iPSCs, and that genetic variation is the main driver of regulatory differences between iPSCs of different donors. Our findings suggest that studies using iPSCs should focus on additional individuals rather than clones from the same individual.}},

ELFs also bound constitutively active, but not poised, macrophage-specific enhancers and promoters. The role of ELFs in promoting high-level constitutive transcription was suggested by multiple evidence: ELF sites enabled robust transcriptional activation by endogenous and minimal synthetic promoters, ELF recruitment was stabilized by the transcriptional machinery, and ELF proteins mediated recruitment of transcriptional and chromatin regulators to core promoters. These data suggest that the co-optation of a limited number of highly active transcription factors represents a broadly adopted strategy to equip both cell type-specific and housekeeping cis-regulatory elements with the ability to efficiently promote transcription.}},

Using the 'basket' method, the ratio of deep rooting (RDR; the proportion of total roots that elongated through the basket bottom) was calculated to evaluate deep rooting. A new major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling RDR was detected on chromosome 9 by using 117 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between the lowland cultivar IR64, with shallow rooting, and the upland cultivar Kinandang Patong (KP), with deep rooting. This QTL explained 66.6\% of the total phenotypic variance in RDR in the RILs. A BC(2)F(3) line homozygous for the KP allele of the QTL had an RDR of 40.4\%, compared with 2.6\% for the homozygous IR64 allele. Fine mapping of this QTL was undertaken using eight BC(2)F(3) recombinant lines. The RDR QTL Dro1 (Deeper rooting 1) was mapped between the markers RM24393 and RM7424, which delimit a 608.4 kb interval in the reference cultivar Nipponbare. To clarify the influence of Dro1 in an upland field, the root distribution in different soil layers was quantified by means of core sampling. A line homozygous for the KP allele of Dro1 (Dro1-KP) and IR64 did not differ in root dry weight in the shallow soil layers (0-25 cm), but root dry weight of Dro1-KP in deep soil layers (25-50 cm) was significantly greater than that of IR64, suggesting that Dro1 plays a crucial role in increased deep rooting under upland field conditions.}},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0023409}, 
  abstract = {{Genome-wide, high-throughput methods for transcription start site (TSS) detection have shown that most promoters have an array of neighboring TSSs where some are used more than others, forming a distribution of initiation propensities. TSS distributions (TSSDs) vary widely between promoters and earlier studies have shown that the TSSDs have biological implications in both regulation and function. However, no systematic study has been made to explore how many types of TSSDs and by extension core promoters exist and to understand which biological features distinguish them. In this study, we developed a new non-parametric dissimilarity measure and clustering approach to explore the similarities and stabilities of clusters of TSSDs. Previous studies have used arbitrary thresholds to arrive at two general classes: broad and sharp. We demonstrated that in addition to the previous broad/sharp dichotomy an additional category of promoters exists. Unlike typical TATA-driven sharp TSSDs where the TSS position can vary a few nucleotides, in this category virtually all TSSs originate from the same genomic position. These promoters lack epigenetic signatures of typical mRNA promoters and a substantial subset of them are mapping upstream of ribosomal protein pseudogenes. We present evidence that these are likely mapping errors, which have confounded earlier analyses, due to the high similarity of ribosomal gene promoters in combination with known G addition bias in the CAGE libraries. Thus, previous two-class separations of promoter based on TSS distributions are motivated, but the ultra-sharp TSS distributions will confound downstream analyses if not removed.}},

However, little is available in our toolbox to link enhancers with their target promoters, hampering mechanistic understanding of enhancer-promoter (EP) interaction. We develop and characterize multiple genomic features for distinguishing true EP pairs from noninteracting pairs. We integrate these features into a probabilistic predictor for EP interactions. Multiple validation experiments demonstrate a significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Systematic analyses of EP interactions across 12 cell types reveal several global features of EP interactions: (i) a larger fraction of EP interactions are cell type specific than enhancers; (ii) promoters controlled by multiple enhancers have higher tissue specificity, but the regulating enhancers are less conserved; (iii) cohesin plays a role in mediating tissue-specific EP interactions via chromatin looping in a CTCF-independent manner. Our approach presents a systematic and effective strategy to decipher the mechanisms underlying EP communication.}},

Unexpectedly, while acute ligand-dependent assembly of eRNPs resulted in enhancer activation sensitive to chemical disruption of phase separation, chronically activated enhancers proved resistant to such disruption, with progressive maturation of eRNPs to a more gel-like state. Acute, but not chronic, stimulation resulted in ligand-induced, condensin-dependent changes in spatial chromatin conformation based on homotypic enhancer association, resulting in cooperative enhancer-activation events. Thus, distinct physicochemical properties of eRNP condensates on enhancers serve as determinants of rapid ligand-dependent alterations in chromosomal architecture and cooperative enhancer activation.}},

We took advantage of oat plants carrying single maize chromosomes in different cultivars, called oat-maize addition (OMA) lines, which permitted us to determine whether regulation of gene expression was conserved between the two species. We found that γ-zeins are expressed in OMA7.06, which carries maize chromosome 7 even in the absence of the trans-acting maize prolamin-box-binding factor (PBF), which regulates their expression. This is likely because oat PBF can substitute for the function of maize PBF as shown in our transient expression data, using a γ-zein promoter fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Despite this conservation, the younger, recently amplified prolamin genes in maize, absent in oat, are not expressed in the corresponding OMAs. However, maize can express the oldest prolamin gene, the wheat high-molecular weight glutenin Dx5 gene, even when maize Pbf is knocked down (through PbfRNAi), and/or another maize transcription factor, Opaque-2 (O2) is knocked out (in maize o2 mutant). Therefore, older genes are conserved in their regulation, whereas younger ones diverged during evolution and eventually acquired a new repertoire of suitable transcriptional activators.}},

The whole macronuclear polymer ends with a portion of the spacer on either end followed by a telomere. Six kinds of macronuclear units, or genes, were mapped. Spacers were different, and transcribed regions were the same. These genes are found in markedly different numbers in the macronucleus. The most common gene shows two regions in the spacer where a sequence is followed by a direct repeat. The next most common gene is similar but shows a deletion plus a number of base pair substitutions. Although most cosmid clones contain only a single kind of gene, many contain more than one. These are thought to be produced by somatic crossing over. The four micronuclear genes that have been isolated consist of a single central transcribed region and portions of the spacer on either end. Sequencing indicates that the two ends of the molecule are partially redundant. While the spacer region at the right end of the macronuclear polymer is derived from the micronuclear spacer on the right, the spacer at the left end of the macronuclear polymer is derived from regions of the micronuclear spacer on both the right and the left. To account for this situation, a rolling-circle model for generation of the macronuclear rDNA from the micronuclear DNA is proposed.}},

These large-scale changes in nuclear architecture were associated with the deposition of activating epigenetic marks across the loop domain, plausibly facilitating phase separation.

  doi = {10.7554/elife.11215}, 
  abstract = {{Genes are sections of DNA that encode the instructions to make proteins. When a gene is switched on, the section of DNA is copied to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) in a process called transcription. These messenger RNAs are then used as templates for protein production. In animals, plants and other eukaryotic organisms, an enzyme called RNA polymerase II is responsible for making messenger RNA molecules during transcription. This enzyme is made up of several proteins, the largest of which contains a long tail, called the carboxy-terminal domain. This domain is crucial for transcription because it serves as a landing platform for other enzymes that help to make the RNA molecules. The carboxy-terminal domain contains multiple repeats of a string of seven amino acids (the building blocks of proteins). Normally, each repeat contains three amino acids called serines. However, in humans and other mammals, one of these serines is often substituted with another amino acid called lysine instead. This lysine (referred to as Lysine-7) was known to be modified by the addition of a chemical group called an 'acetyl' tag, but it was not clear how this tag affected transcription. Dias, Rito, Torlai Triglia et al. carried out an in-depth study into how Lysine-7 is modified in mouse cells, and what effects these modifications have on transcription. The experiments show that Lysine-7 can also be modified by the addition of a different chemical group, called a 'methyl' tag. This new modification is also found in flies, worms and human cells, which suggests that it is generally important for transcription. Next, Dias, Rito, Torlai Triglia et al. found that in mouse stem cells, methyl tags are added to Lysine-7 during the earliest steps of transcription, before the acetyl tags are added. Further experiments show that a balance between the addition of methyl tags and acetyl tags to Lysine-7 fine-tunes the activity of RNA polymerase II. These findings add to our understanding of how cells control the activity of RNA polymerase II at different genes. Future challenges are to find out which enzymes are responsible for adding and removing these chemical tags, and how the balance between the methyl and acetyl modifications is controlled.}},

In Arabidopsis thaliana however, isoform switches have only been reported for 812 genes and the characteristics of these genes, nor the implications of the isoform switches on their protein functions, are currently well understood. Here we present a dataset of isoform dominance and switching for all genes in the AtRTD2 annotation based on a protocol that was benchmarked on simulated data and validated through comparison with a published RT-PCR panel. We report 138,722 isoform switches for 8,162 genes across 206 public RNA-Seq samples and find that these switches change the protein sequences in 23\% of the cases. The observed isoform switches show high consistency across replicates and reveal reproducible patterns in response to treatment and development. We also demonstrate that genes with different ages, expression breadths, and functions show large differences in the frequency at which they switch isoforms and in the effect that these isoform switches have on their protein sequences. Finally, we showcase how the detected isoform switches can be applied to gain further insight in the regulation of a gene9s expression and function.</p>}},

  abstract = {{<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3> <p>Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and there is great need to define the molecular mechanisms driving the development and progression of individual tumors. The Hallmarks of Cancer has provided a framework for a deeper molecular understanding of cancer, and the focus so far has been on the genetic alterations in individual cancers, including genome rearrangements, gene amplifications, and specific cancer-driving mutations. Using systems-level approaches, it is now also possible to define downstream effects of individual genetic alterations in a genome-wide manner.</p><h3>RATIONALE</h3> <p>In our study, we used a systems-level approach to analyze the transcriptome of 17 major cancer types with respect to clinical outcome, based on a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis of \textbackslashtextasciitilde8000 individual patients with clinical metadata. The study was made possible through the availability of large open-access knowledge-based efforts such as the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Human Protein Atlas. Here, we used the data to perform a systems-level analysis of 17 major human cancer types, describing both interindividual and intertumor variation patterns.</p><h3>RESULTS</h3> <p>The analysis identified candidate prognostic genes associated with clinical outcome for each tumor type; the results show that a large fraction of cancer protein-coding genes are differentially expressed and, in many cases, have an impact on overall patient survival. Systems biology analyses revealed that gene expression of individual tumors within a particular cancer varied considerably and could exceed the variation observed between distinct cancer types. No general prognostic gene necessary for clinical outcome was applicable to all cancers. Shorter patient survival was generally associated with up-regulation of genes involved in mitosis and cell growth and down-regulation of genes involved in cellular differentiation. The data allowed us to generate personalized genome-scale metabolic models for cancer patients to identify key genes involved in tumor growth. In addition, we explored tissue-specific genes associated with the dedifferentiation of tumor cells and the role of specific cancer testis antigens on a genome-wide scale. For lung and colorectal cancer, a selection of prognostic genes identified by the systems biology effort were analyzed in independent, prospective cancer cohorts using immunohistochemistry to validate the gene expression patterns at the protein level. </p><h3>CONCLUSION</h3> <p>A Human Pathology Atlas has been created as part of the Human Protein Atlas program to explore the prognostic role of each protein-coding gene in 17 different cancers. Our atlas uses transcriptomics and antibody-based profiling to provide a standalone resource for cancer precision medicine. The results demonstrate the power of large systems biology efforts that make use of publicly available resources. Using genome-scale metabolic models, cancer patients are shown to have widespread metabolic heterogeneity, highlighting the need for precise and personalized medicine for cancer treatment. With more than 900,000 Kaplan-Meier plots, this resource allows exploration of the specific genes influencing clinical outcome for major cancers, paving the way for further in-depth studies incorporating systems-level analyses of cancer. All data presented are available in an interactive open-access database (www.proteinatlas.org/pathology) to allow for genome-wide exploration of the impact of individual proteins on clinical outcome in major human cancers.</p>}},

We find that HoxD genes compete for a remote enhancer that recognizes the locus in a polar fashion, with a preference for the 5′ extremity. Modifications in either the number or topography of Hoxd loci induced regulatory reallocations affecting both the number and morphology of digits. These results demonstrate why genes located at the extremity of the cluster are expressed at the distal end of the limbs, following a gradual reduction in transcriptional efficiency, and thus highlight the mechanistic nature of collinearity in limbs.}},

  doi = {10.1534/genetics.110.119594}, 
  abstract = {{Models for detecting the effect of adaptation on population genomic diversity are often predicated on a single newly arisen mutation sweeping rapidly to fixation. However, a population can also adapt to a new environment by multiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel, at the same locus or different loci. These mutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single one from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally, leading to a "soft" sweep in the population. Here we study various models of parallel mutation in a continuous, geographically spread population adapting to a global selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele due to limited dispersal can allow other selected alleles to arise and start to spread elsewhere in the species range. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow dramatically and so initially form a geographic patchwork, a random tessellation, which could be mistaken for a signal of local adaptation. This spatial tessellation will dissipate over time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within the global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed by mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of crystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel mutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs are captured by a single compound parameter, a characteristic length, which reflects the expected distance a spreading allele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This characteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter, the effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the strength of selection. While our knowledge of these parameters is poor, we argue that even in widely dispersing species, such parallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict that as more data become available, many more examples of intraspecies parallel adaptation will be uncovered.}},

We conducted genetic screens to identify the negative regulators of <i>HO</i> expression necessary to limit <i>HO</i> transcription. Known repressors of <i>HO</i> (Ash1 and Rpd3) were identified, as well as several additional chromatin-associated factors including the Hda1 histone deacetylase, the Isw2 chromatin remodeler, and the corepressor Tup1. We also identified clusters of <i>HO</i> promoter mutations that suggested roles for the Dot6/Tod6 (PAC site) and Ume6 repression pathways. We used ChIP assays with synchronized cells to validate the involvement of these factors and map the association of Ash1, Dot6, and Ume6 with the <i>HO</i> promoter to a brief window in the cell cycle between binding of the initial activating transcription factor and initiation of transcription. We found that Ash1 and Ume6 each recruit the Rpd3 histone deacetylase to <i>HO</i>, and their effects are additive. In contrast, Rpd3 was not recruited significantly to the PAC site, suggesting this site has a distinct mechanism for repression. Increases in <i>HO</i> expression and SWI/SNF recruitment were all additive upon loss of Ash1, Ume6, and PAC site factors, indicating the convergence of independent pathways for repression. Our results demonstrate that multiple protein complexes are important for limiting the spread of SWI/SNF mediated nucleosome eviction across the <i>HO</i> promoter, suggesting that regulation requires a delicate balance of activities that promote and repress transcription.</p>}},

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV underscores the threat of cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans. Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations1. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system2, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.}},

We apply GoT to profile 38,290 CD34+ cells from patients with CALR-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms to study how somatic mutations corrupt the complex process of human haematopoiesis. High-resolution mapping of malignant versus normal haematopoietic progenitors revealed an increasing fitness advantage with myeloid differentiation of cells with mutated CALR. We identified the unfolded protein response as a predominant outcome of CALR mutations, with a considerable dependency on cell identity, as well as upregulation of the NF-κB pathway specifically in uncommitted stem cells. We further extended the GoT toolkit to genotype multiple targets and loci that are distant from transcript ends. Together, these findings reveal that the transcriptional output of somatic mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms is dependent on the native cell identity.}},

It is fairly easy to understand how selection might have shaped these horns, but understanding how development shaped them from a hornless ancestor is a much more complex proposition. Hu et al. show that these horns are generated from wing homologs and argue that many other insect traits may have followed similar transcriptional paths (see the Perspective by Nijhout). Science , this issue p. [1004][1]; see also p. [946][2] Understanding how novel complex traits originate is a foundational challenge in evolutionary biology. We investigated the origin of prothoracic horns in scarabaeine beetles, one of the most pronounced examples of secondary sexual traits in the animal kingdom. We show that prothoracic horns derive from bilateral source tissues; that diverse wing genes are functionally required for instructing this process; and that, in the absence of Hox input, prothoracic horn primordia transform to contribute to ectopic wings. Once induced, however, the transcriptional profile of prothoracic horns diverges markedly from that of wings and other wing serial homologs. Our results substantiate the serial homology between prothoracic horns and insects wings and suggest that other insect innovations may derive similarly from wing serial homologs and the concomitant establishment of structure-specific transcriptional landscapes.

Our approach is based on the observation that two large classes of biophysical models for cis-regulatory mechanisms can be expressed as deep neural networks in which nodes and weights have explicit physiochemical interpretations. We also demonstrate how such biophysical networks can be rapidly learned, using modern deep learning frameworks, from the data produced by certain types of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). These results suggest a scalable strategy for using MPRAs to systematically characterize the biophysical basis of gene regulation in a wide range of biological contexts.

Both genomes differed markedly in genome size and structure, and in gene family composition, revealing their dynamic nature, presumably in response to adaptations to their contrasting environments.

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The relationship between genetic variation in gene expression and phenotypic variation observable in nature is not well understood. Identifying how many phenotypes are associated with differences in gene expression and how many gene-expression differences are associated with a phenotype is important to understanding the molecular basis and evolution of complex traits.

RESULTS:We compared levels of gene expression among nine natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown either in the presence or absence of copper sulfate. Of the nine strains, two show a reduced growth rate and two others are rust colored in the presence of copper sulfate. We identified 633 genes that show significant differences in expression among strains. Of these genes, 20 were correlated with resistance to copper sulfate and 24 were correlated with rust coloration. The function of these genes in combination with their expression pattern suggests the presence of both correlative and causative expression differences. But the majority of differentially expressed genes were not correlated with either phenotype and showed the same expression pattern both in the presence and absence of copper sulfate. To determine whether these expression differences may contribute to phenotypic variation under other environmental conditions, we examined one phenotype, freeze tolerance, predicted by the differential expression of the aquaporin gene AQY2. We found freeze tolerance is associated with the expression of AQY2.

CONCLUSIONS:Gene expression differences provide substantial insight into the molecular basis of naturally occurring traits and can be used to predict environment dependent phenotypic variation.}},

  abstract = {{Author Summary The human genome contains an immense amount of non-protein-coding DNA with unknown function. Some of this DNA regulates when, where, and at what levels genes are active during development. Enhancers, one type of regulatory element, are short stretches of DNA that can act as “switches” to turn a gene on or off at specific times in specific cells or tissues. Understanding where in the genome enhancers are located can provide insight into the genetic basis of development and disease. Enhancers are hard to identify, but clues about their locations are found in different types of data including DNA sequence, evolutionary history, and where proteins bind to DNA. Here, we introduce a new tool, called EnhancerFinder, which combines these data to predict the location and activity of enhancers during embryonic development. We trained EnhancerFinder on a large set of functionally validated human enhancers, and it proved to be very accurate. We used EnhancerFinder to predict tens of thousands of enhancers in the human genome and validated several of the predictions near three important developmental genes in mouse or zebrafish. EnhancerFinder's predictions will be useful in understanding functional regions hidden in the vast amounts of human non-coding DNA.}},

Motivating an independent role for shape, many TF binding sites lack a sequence-motif, DNA shape adds specificity to sequence-motifs, and different sequences can encode similar shapes. We therefore asked if binding sites of a TF are enriched for specific patterns of DNA shape-features, e.g., helical twist. We developed ShapeMF, which discovers these shape-motifs de novo without taking sequence information into account. We find that most TFs assayed in ENCODE have shape-motifs and bind regulatory regions recognizing shape-motifs in the absence of sequence-motifs. When shape- and sequence-recognition co-occur, the two types of motifs can be overlapping, flanking, or separated by consistent spacing. Shape-motifs are prevalent in regions co-bound by multiple TFs. Finally, TFs with identical sequence motifs have different shape-motifs, explaining their binding at distinct locations. These results establish shape-motifs as drivers of TF-DNA recognition complementary to sequence-motifs.</p>}},

The negative association between fertility and longevity found throughout multicellular organisms supports this prediction. As an important exception, the reproductives of many eusocial insects (ants, bees, termites) are simultaneously very long-lived and highly fertile. Here, we examine the proximate basis for this exceptional relationship by comparing whole body transcriptomes of differently aged queens of the ant Cardiocondyla obscurior. We show that the sets of genes differentially expressed with age significantly overlap with age-related expression changes previously found in female Drosophila melanogaster. We identified several developmental processes, such as the generation of neurons, as common signatures of aging. More generally, however, gene expression in ant queens and flies changes with age mainly in opposite directions. In contrast to flies, reproduction-associated genes were upregulated and genes associated with metabolic processes and muscle contraction were downregulated in old relative to young ant queens. Furthermore, we searched for putative C. obscurior longevity candidates associated with the previously reported lifespan-prolonging effect of mating by comparing the transcriptomes of queens that differed in mating and reproductive status. We found 21 genes, including the putative aging candidate NLaz (an insect homolog of APOD), which were consistently more highly expressed in short-lived, unmated queens than in long-lived, mated queens. Our study provides clear evidence that the alternative regulation of conserved molecular pathways that mediate the interplay among mating, egg laying, and aging underlies the lack of the fecundity/longevity trade-off in ant queens.}},

In active, but not inactive, promoters, mutation frequencies for cytosines at the 5' end of this ETS-like motif were considerably higher than expected based on a UV trinucleotide mutation signature. Additional analyses solidify this pattern as an extended context-specific mutational signature that mediates an exceptional position-specific elevation in local mutation rate, arguing against positive selection.

Several studies have advocated aggregating complementary algorithms, combining their predictions to increase the accuracy of the results. This led to the development of ensemble methods. To form a better view on modern ensembles, we review all compound tools designed for ChIP-Seq. After a brief introduction to basic algorithms and early ensembles, we describe the most recent tools. We highlight their limitations and strengths by presenting their architecture, the input options and their output. To provide guidance for next-generation sequencing practitioners, we observe the differences and similarities between them. Last but not least, we identify and recommend several features to be implemented by any novel ensemble algorithm.}},

In this work, we used spatial and temporal transcriptomic data to predict interactions among the genes involved in stem cell regulation.

Here we present GERP++, a new tool that uses maximum likelihood evolutionary rate estimation for position-specific scoring and, in contrast to previous bottom-up methods, a novel dynamic programming approach to subsequently define constrained elements. GERP++ evaluates a richer set of candidate element breakpoints and ranks them based on statistical significance, eliminating the need for biased heuristic extension techniques. Using GERP++ we identify over 1.3 million constrained elements spanning over 7\% of the human genome. We predict a higher fraction than earlier estimates largely due to the annotation of longer constrained elements, which improves one to one correspondence between predicted elements with known functional sequences. GERP++ is an efficient and effective tool to provide both nucleotide- and element-level constraint scores within deep multiple sequence alignments.}},

Here we characterize three new individual TE-derived human lincRNAs, human pluripotency-associated transcripts 2, 3 and 5 (HPAT2, HPAT3 and HPAT5). Loss-of-function experiments indicate that HPAT2, HPAT3 and HPAT5 function in preimplantation embryo development to modulate the acquisition of pluripotency and the formation of the inner cell mass. CRISPR-mediated disruption of the genes for these lincRNAs in pluripotent stem cells, followed by whole-transcriptome analysis, identifies HPAT5 as a key component of the pluripotency network. Protein binding and reporter-based assays further demonstrate that HPAT5 interacts with the let-7 microRNA family.

  abstract = {{<p>The availability of a large volume of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets for various transcription factors (TF) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify all functional TF binding motifs clustered in the enhancers in genomes. However, the progress has been largely hindered by the lack of a highly efficient and accurate tool that is fast enough to find not only the target motifs, but also cooperative motifs contained in very large ChIP-seq datasets with a binding peak length of typical enhancers (\textbackslashtextasciitilde1,000 bp). To circumvent this hurdle, we herein present an ultra-fast and highly accurate motif-finding algorithm, ProSampler, with automatic motif length detection. ProSampler first identifies significant k-mers in the dataset and combines highly similar significant k-mers to form preliminary motifs. ProSampler then merges preliminary motifs with subtle similarity using a novel graph-based Gibbs sampler to find core motifs. Finally, ProSampler extends the core motifs by applying a two-proportion z-test to the flanking positions to identify motifs longer than k. As the number of preliminary motifs is much smaller than that of k-mers in a dataset, we greatly reduce the search space of the Gibbs sampler compared with conventional ones. By storing flanking sequences in a hash table, we avoid extensive IO and the necessity of examining all lengths of motifs in an interval. When evaluated on both synthetic and real ChIP-seq datasets, ProSampler runs orders of magnitude faster than the fastest existing tools while more accurately discovering primary motifs as well as cooperative motifs than do the best existing tools. Using ProSampler, we revealed previously unknown complex motif occurrence patterns in large ChIP-seq datasets, thereby providing insights into the mechanisms of cooperative TF binding for gene transcriptional regulation. Therefore, by allowing fast and accurate mining of the entire ChIP-seq datasets, ProSampler can greatly facilitate the efforts to identify the entire cis-regulatory code in genomes.</p>}},

Thousands of CpG sites whose tissue-specific methylation levels are strongly correlated with chronological age have been previously identified. However, the majority of these studies have focused primarily on cosmopolitan populations living in the developed world; it is not known if age-related patterns of DNA methylation at these loci are similar across a broad range of human genetic and ecological diversity. We investigated genome-wide methylation patterns using saliva- and whole blood-derived DNA from two traditionally hunting and gathering African populations: the Baka of the western Central African rainforest and the ≠Khomani San of the South African Kalahari Desert. We identified hundreds of CpG sites whose methylation levels are significantly associated with age, thousands that are significant in a meta-analysis, and replicate trends previously reported in populations of non-African descent. We confirmed that an age-associated site in the promoter of the gene <i>ELOVL2</i> shows a remarkably congruent relationship with aging in humans, despite extensive genetic and environmental variation across populations. We also demonstrate that genotype state at methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) can affect methylation trends at some age-associated CpG sites. Our study explores the relationship between CpG methylation and chronological age in populations of African hunter-gatherers, who rely on different diets across diverse ecologies. While many age-related CpG sites replicate across populations, we show that considering common genetic variation at meQTLs further improves our ability to detect previously identified age associations.</p>}},

We investigated the evolution of liver promoters and enhancers in six primate species using ChIP-seq (H3K27ac and H3K4me1) to profile cis-regulatory elements (CREs), and RNA-seq to characterize gene expression in the same individuals. To quantify regulatory divergence, we compared CRE activity across species by testing differential ChIP-seq read depths directly measured for orthologous sequences. We show that the primate regulatory landscape is largely conserved across the lineage, with 63\% of the tested human liver CREs showing similar activity across species. Conserved CRE function is associated with sequence conservation, proximity to coding genes, cell-type specificity, and transcription factor binding. Newly evolved CREs are enriched in immune response and neurodevelopmental functions. We further demonstrate that conserved CREs bind master regulators, suggesting that while CREs contribute to species adaptation to the environment, core functions remain intact. Newly evolved CREs are enriched in young transposable elements, including Long-Terminal-Repeats (LTR) and SINE-VNTR-Alus (SVAs), that significantly affect gene expression. Conversely, only 16\% of conserved CREs overlap TEs. We tested the cis-regulatory activity of 69 TE subfamilies by luciferase reporter assays, spanning all major TE classes, and showed that 95.6\% of tested TEs can function as either transcriptional activators or repressors. In conclusion, we demonstrated the critical role of TEs in the primate gene regulation, and illustrated the potential mechanisms underlying evolutionary divergence among the primate species through the non-coding genome.}},

High-throughput sequencing of the bound RNAs revealed strong Set1 enrichment near the transcription start site, whereas Set2 was distributed along pre-mRNAs. A subset of transcripts showed notably high enrichment for Set1 or Set2 binding relative to RNAPII, suggesting functional post-transcriptional interactions. In particular, Set1 was strongly bound to the SET1 mRNA, Ty1 retrotransposons, and non-coding RNAs from the rDNA intergenic spacers, consistent with its previously reported silencing roles. Set1 lacking RRM2 showed reduced in vivo crosslinking to RNA and reduced chromatin occupancy. In addition, levels of H3K4 tri-methylation were decreased whereas di-methylation was increased.

There is emerging evidence that regulatory elements associated with particular traits or diseases share similar patterns of transcriptional activity. Accordingly, shared transcriptional activity (coexpression) may help prioritise loci associated with a given trait, and help to identify underlying biological processes. Using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) profiles of promoter- and enhancer-derived RNAs across 1824 human samples, we have analysed coexpression of RNAs originating from trait-associated regulatory regions using a novel quantitative method (network density analysis; NDA). For most traits studied, phenotype-associated variants in regulatory regions were linked to tightly-coexpressed networks that are likely to share important functional characteristics. Coexpression provides a new signal, independent of phenotype association, to enable fine mapping of causative variants. The NDA coexpression approach identifies new genetic variants associated with specific traits, including an association between the regulation of the OCT1 cation transporter and genetic variants underlying circulating cholesterol levels. NDA strongly implicates particular cell types and tissues in disease pathogenesis. For example, distinct groupings of disease-associated regulatory regions implicate two distinct biological processes in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis; a further two separate processes are implicated in Crohn’s disease. Thus, our functional analysis of genetic predisposition to disease defines new distinct disease endotypes. We predict that patients with a preponderance of susceptibility variants in each group are likely to respond differently to pharmacological therapy. Together, these findings enable a deeper biological understanding of the causal basis of complex traits.}},

TEs have been particularly effective in colonizing mammalian genomes, and such heavy TE load is expected to have conditioned genome evolution.

Here, we critically review the evidence for exaptation of TE-derived sequences as TFBSs, promoters, enhancers, and silencers/insulators both at the gene and genome levels. We classify the functional impact attributed to TE insertions into four categories of increasing complexity and argue that so far very few studies have conclusively demonstrated exaptation of TEs as transcriptional regulatory regions. We also contend that many genome-wide studies dealing with TE exaptation in recent lineages of mammals are still inconclusive and that the hypothesis of rapid transcriptional regulatory rewiring mediated by TE mobilization must be taken with caution. Finally, we suggest experimental approaches that may help attributing higher-order functions to candidate exapted TEs.}},

Turnover has been demonstrated previously for transcription-factor-binding sites. Here, we show that transcription start sites of equivalent genes do not always reside at equivalent locations in the human and mouse genomes.

  abstract = {{In humans, the adaptive immune system uses the exchange of information between cells to detect and eliminate foreign or damaged cells; however, the removal of unwanted cells does not always require an adaptive immune system1,2. For example, cell selection in Drosophila uses a cell selection mechanism based on ‘fitness fingerprints’, which allow it to delay ageing3, prevent developmental malformations3,4 and replace old tissues during regeneration5. At the molecular level, these fitness fingerprints consist of combinations of Flower membrane proteins3,4,6. Proteins that indicate reduced fitness are called Flower-Lose, because they are expressed in cells marked to be eliminated6. However, the presence of Flower-Lose isoforms at a cell’s membrane does not always lead to elimination, because if neighbouring cells have similar levels of Lose proteins, the cell will not be killed4,6,7. Humans could benefit from the capability to recognize unfit cells, because accumulation of damaged but viable cells during development and ageing causes organ dysfunction and disease8–17. However, in Drosophila this mechanism is hijacked by premalignant cells to gain a competitive growth advantage18. This would be undesirable for humans because it might make tumours more aggressive19–21. It is unknown whether a similar mechanism of cell-fitness comparison is present in humans. Here we show that two human Flower isoforms (hFWE1 and hFWE3) behave as Flower-Lose proteins, whereas the other two isoforms (hFWE2 and hFWE4) behave as Flower-Win proteins. The latter give cells a competitive advantage over cells expressing Lose isoforms, but Lose-expressing cells are not eliminated if their neighbours express similar levels of Lose isoforms; these proteins therefore act as fitness fingerprints. Moreover, human cancer cells show increased Win isoform expression and proliferate in the presence of Lose-expressing stroma, which confers a competitive growth advantage on the cancer cells. Inhibition of the expression of Flower proteins reduces tumour growth and metastasis, and induces sensitivity to chemotherapy. Our results show that ancient mechanisms of cell recognition and selection are active in humans and affect oncogenic growth. A cell competition mechanism based on the differential expression of isoforms of Flower proteins is found in humans as well as Drosophila, and promotes tumorigenesis.}},

Our method, which we call BreakCA for Breaks in Chromatin Accessible regions, allows non-coding indels to be discovered in the absence of whole genome sequencing data, out-performs popular variant callers such as the GATK-HaplotypeCaller and VarScan2, and detects known oncogenic regulatory mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. We apply BreakCA to identify indels in H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks in 23 neuroblastoma cell lines and, after removing common germline variants, we identify 23 rare germline or somatic indels that occur in multiple neuroblastoma cell lines. Among them, 4 indels are candidate oncogenic drivers that are present in 4 or 5 cell lines, absent from the genome aggregation database of over 15,000 whole genome sequences, and within the promoters or first introns of known genes (PHF21A, ADAMTS19, GPR85 and RALGDS). In addition, we observe a rare 7bp germline deletion in two cell lines, which is associated with high expression of the histone demethylase KDM5B. Overexpression of KDM5B is prognostic for many cancers and further characterization of this indel as a potential oncogenic risk factor is therefore warranted.</p>}},

Genomic DNase I footprinting enables the quantitative, nucleotide-resolution delineation of sites of transcription factor occupancy within native chromatin3–6. However, only a small fraction of such sites have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence6. Here, to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from 243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that encode transcription factor occupancy at nucleotide resolution. We map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase I-hypersensitive sites and show that the overwhelming majority are populated by well-spaced sites of single transcription factor–DNA interaction. Cell-context-dependent cis-regulation is chiefly executed by wholesale modulation of accessibility at regulatory DNA rather than by differential transcription factor occupancy within accessible elements. We also show that the enrichment of genetic variants associated with diseases or phenotypic traits in regulatory regions1,7 is almost entirely attributable to variants within footprints, and that functional variants that affect transcription factor occupancy are nearly evenly partitioned between loss- and gain-of-function alleles. Unexpectedly, we find increased density of human genetic variation within transcription factor footprints, revealing an unappreciated driver of cis-regulatory evolution. Our results provide a framework for both global and nucleotide-precision analyses of gene regulatory mechanisms and functional genetic variation. A high-density DNase I cleavage map from 243 human cell and tissue types provides a genome-wide, nucleotide-resolution map of human transcription factor footprints.}},

Whereas cis effects are caused by genetic variants in close proximity to the target gene, trans effects are due to distal genetic variants that affect diffusible elements such as transcription factors. Previous studies have mostly assessed the impact of cis and trans effects at the gene level. However, how cis and trans effects differentially impact regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters remains poorly understood. Here, we used massively parallel reporter assays to directly measure cis and trans effects between human and mouse embryonic stem cells at thousands of individual regulatory elements. Our approach revealed that cis effects are widespread across regulatory elements, and the strongest cis effects are associated with the disruption of motifs recognized by strong transcriptional activators. Conversely, we found that trans effects are rare but stronger in enhancers than promoters, and can be attributed to a subset of transcription factors that are differentially expressed between human and mouse. While previous studies have found extensive co-occurrence of cis and trans effects in opposite directions that stabilize gene expression throughout evolution, we find that cis-trans compensation is uncommon within individual regulatory elements. Thus, our results are consistent with a model wherein compensatory cis-trans effects at the gene level are explained by cis and trans effects that separately impact several regulatory elements rather than cis-trans effects that occur simultaneously within a single regulatory element. Together, these results indicate that studying the evolution of individual regulatory elements is pivotal to understand the tempo and mode of gene expression evolution.</p>}},

The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size (<i>N</i><sub>e</sub> = 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct.

By examining the occupancy of the Drosophila pleiohomeotic repressive complex (PhoRC) during embryogenesis, we revealed extensive co-occupancy at developmental enhancers. Using an established in vivo assay for PRE activity, we demonstrated that a subset of characterized developmental enhancers can function as PREs, silencing transcription in a Polycomb-dependent manner. Conversely, some classic Drosophila PREs can function as developmental enhancers in vivo, activating spatio-temporal expression. This study therefore uncovers elements with dual function: activating transcription in some cells (enhancers) while stably maintaining transcriptional silencing in others (PREs). Given that enhancers initiate spatio-temporal gene expression, reuse of the same elements by the Polycomb group (PcG) system may help fine-tune gene expression and ensure the timely maintenance of cell identities.}},

Here, we explore the potential of elucidating regulatory systems in varied cell types using computational techniques that rely on only data of gene expression, low-resolution chromatin accessibility, and TF-DNA binding specificities ('motifs'). We show that static computational motif scans overlaid with chromatin accessibility data reasonably approximate experimentally measured TF-DNA binding. We demonstrate that predicted binding profiles and expression patterns of hundreds of TFs are sufficient to identify major regulators of ∼200 spatiotemporal expression domains in the Drosophila embryo. We are then able to learn reliable statistical models of enhancer activity for over 70 expression domains and apply those models to annotate domain specific enhancers genome-wide.

LincRNAs are less evolutionarily conserved, less abundant, and more tissue-specific, suggesting that their pre- and post-transcriptional regulation is different from that of mRNAs. Here, we perform an in-depth characterization of the features that contribute to lincRNA regulation in multiple human cell lines. We find that lincRNA promoters are depleted of transcription factor (TF) binding sites, yet enriched for some specific factors such as GATA and FOS relative to mRNA promoters. Surprisingly, we find that H3K9me3, a histone modification typically associated with transcriptional repression, is more enriched at the promoters of active lincRNA loci than at those of active mRNAs. Moreover, H3K9me3-marked lincRNA genes are more tissue-specific. The most discriminant differences between lincRNAs and mRNAs involve splicing. LincRNAs are less efficiently spliced, which cannot be explained by differences in U1 binding or the density of exonic splicing enhancers, but may be partially attributed to lower U2AF65 binding and weaker splicing-related motifs. Conversely, the stability of lincRNAs and mRNAs is similar, differing only with regard to the location of stabilizing protein binding sites. Finally, we find that certain transcriptional properties are correlated with higher evolutionary conservation in both DNA and RNA motifs, and are enriched in lincRNAs that have been functionally characterized.}},

As miRNA expression is highly cell specific, an automatic and systematic method that could identify miRNA TSSs accurately and cell specifically is in urgent requirement.

RESULTS:A workflow to identify the TSSs of miRNAs was built by integrating the data of H3K4me3 and DNase I hypersensitive sites as well as combining the conservation level and sequence feature. By applying the workflow to the data for 54 cell lines from the ENCODE project, we successfully identified TSSs for 663 intragenic miRNAs and 620 intergenic miRNAs, which cover 84.2\% (1283/1523) of all miRNAs recorded in miRBase 18. For these cell lines, we found 4042 alternative TSSs for intragenic miRNAs and 3186 alternative TSSs for intergenic miRNAs. Our method achieved a better performance than the previous non-cell-specific methods on miRNA TSSs. The cell-specific method developed by Georgakilas et al. gives 158 TSSs of higher accuracy in two cell lines, benefitting from the employment of deep-sequencing technique. In contrast, our method provided a much higher number of miRNA TSSs (7228) for a broader range of cell lines without the limitation of costly deep-sequencing data, thus being more applicable for various experimental cases. Analysis showed that upstream promoters at - 2 kb to - 200 bp of TSS are more conserved for independently transcribed miRNAs, while for miRNAs transcribed with host genes, their core promoters (-200 bp to 200 bp of TSS) are significantly conserved.

  abstract = {{Developmental genes in metazoan genomes are surrounded by dense clusters of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). CNEs exhibit unexplained extreme levels of sequence conservation, with many acting as developmental long-range enhancers. Clusters of CNEs define the span of regulatory inputs for many important developmental regulators and have been described previously as genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). Their function and distribution around important regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to 3D conformation of these loci. Here, we show that clusters of CNEs strongly coincide with topological organisation, predicting the boundaries of hundreds of topologically associating domains (TADs) in human and Drosophila. The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of noncoding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs devoid of extreme noncoding conservation. The close correspondence between extreme noncoding conservation and TADs suggests that these TADs are ancient, revealing a regulatory architecture conserved over hundreds of millions of years. Metazoan genomes contain many clusters of conserved noncoding elements. Here, the authors provide evidence that these clusters coincide with distinct topologically associating domains in humans and Drosophila, revealing a conserved regulatory genomic architecture.}},

  abstract = {{Characterizing recurring sequence patterns in human promoters has been a challenging undertaking even nowadays where a near-complete overview of promoters exists. However, with the more recent availability of genomic location (ChIP-seq) data, one can approach that question through the identification of characteristic patterns of transcription factor occupancy and histone modifications. Based on the ENCODE annotation and integration of sequence motifs as well as three-dimensional chromatin data, we have undertaken a re-analysis of occupancy and sequence patterns in human promoters. We identify clear groups of CAAT-box and E-box sequence motif containing promoters, as well as a group of promoters whose interaction with an enhancer appears to be mediated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding on the promoter. We also extend our analysis to inactive promoters, showing that only a surprisingly small number of inactive promoters is repressed by the polycomb complex. We also identify combinatorial patterns of transcription factor interactions indicated by the ChIP-seq signals. Our analysis defines subgroups of promoters characterized by stereotypic patterns of transcription factor occupancy, and combinations of specific sequence patterns which are required for their binding. This grouping provides new hypotheses concerning the assembly and dynamics of transcription factor complexes at their respective promoter groups, as well as questions on the evolutionary origin of these groups.}},

Enhancers can stimulate gene activity at great genomic distances from their targets, raising questions about how enhancers communicate with specific gene promoters and what molecular mechanisms underlie enhancer function. Characterization of enhancer loci has identified the molecular features of active enhancers that accompany the binding of transcription factors and local opening of chromatin. These characteristics include coactivator recruitment, histone modifications, and noncoding RNA transcription. However, it remains unclear which of these features functionally contribute to enhancer activity. Here, we discuss what is known about how enhancers regulate their target genes and how enhancers and promoters communicate.

To characterize evolutionary patterns of genome wide gene expression in reproductive tissues in the gametophyte and to compare them to developmental stages of the sporophyte, we analyzed evolutionary conservation and genetic diversity of protein-coding genes using microarray-based transcriptome data from three plant species,Arabidopsis thaliana, rice (Oryza sativa), and soybean (Glycine max). In all three species a significant shift in gene expression occurs during gametogenesis in which genes of younger evolutionary age and higher genetic diversity contribute significantly more to the transcriptome than in other stages. We refer to this phenomenon as "evolutionary bulge" during plant reproductive development because it differentiates the gametophyte from the sporophyte. We show that multiple, not mutually exclusive, causes may explain the bulge pattern, most prominently reduced tissue complexity of the gametophyte, a varying extent of selection on reproductive traits during gametogenesis as well as differences between male and female tissues. This highlights the importance of plant reproduction for understanding evolutionary forces determining the relationship of genomic and phenotypic variation in plants.}},

We find that nucleosomes significantly restrict Pho4 binding. At nucleosome-depleted sites, competition from another transcription factor, Cbf1, determines Pho4 occupancy, raising the threshold for transcriptional activation in phosphate replete conditions and preventing Pho4 activation of genes outside the phosphate regulon during phosphate starvation. Pho4 binding is not sufficient for transcriptional activation—a cooperative interaction between Pho2 and Pho4 specifies genes that are activated. Combining these experimental observations, we are able to globally predict Pho4 binding and its functionality.}},

He reiterated this point a few years later in proposing that without duplicated genes the creation of metazoans, vertebrates, and mammals from unicellular organisms would have been impossible. Such big leaps in evolution, he argued, required the creation of new gene loci with previously nonexistent functions (98). Bold statements such as these, combined with his proposal that at least one whole-genome duplication event facilitated the evolution of vertebrates, have made Ohno an icon in the literature on genome evolution. However, discussion on the occurrence and consequences of gene and genome duplication events has a much longer, and often neglected, history. Here we review literature dealing with the occurence and consequences of gene duplication, begining in 1911. We document conceptual and technological advances in gene duplication research from this early research in comparative cytology up to recent research on whole genomes, “transcriptomes,” and “interactomes.”We have formerly seen that parts many times repeated are eminently liable to vary in number and structure; consequently it is quite probable that natural selection, during the long-continued course of modification, should have seized on a certain number of the primordially similar elements, many times repeated, and have adapted them to the most diverse purposes.     Charles Darwin, 1859 (23)}},

To understand how robustness varies across genotypes, we measure the fitness effects of hundreds of individual insertion mutations in a panel of yeast strains. We find that more-fit strains are less robust: They have distributions of fitness effects with lower mean and higher variance. These differences arise because many mutations have more strongly deleterious effects in faster-growing strains. This negative correlation between fitness and robustness implies that second-order selection for robustness will tend to conflict with first-order selection for fitness.}},

In this Review, we discuss the defining properties of gene core promoters, including their sequence features, chromatin architecture and transcription initiation patterns.

On the basis of the established properties of gene core promoters, we discuss transcription start sites within enhancers and integrate recent results obtained from dedicated functional assays to propose a functional model of transcription initiation.

Expression of three homeotic genes, Ubx, abd-A, and Abd-B, is orchestrated by nine parasegment-specific regulatory domains. These domains are flanked by boundary elements, which function to block crosstalk between adjacent domains, ensuring that they can act autonomously. Paradoxically, seven of the BX-C regulatory domains are separated from their gene target by at least one boundary, and must “jump over” the intervening boundaries. To understand the jumping mechanism, the Mcp boundary was replaced with Fab-7 and Fab-8. Mcp is located between the iab-4 and iab-5 domains, and defines the border between the set of regulatory domains controlling abd-A and Abd-B. When Mcp is replaced by Fab-7 or Fab-8, they direct the iab-4 domain (which regulates abd-A) to inappropriately activate Abd-B in abdominal segment A4. For the Fab-8 replacement, ectopic induction was only observed when it was inserted in the same orientation as the endogenous Fab-8 boundary. A similar orientation dependence for bypass activity was observed when Fab-7 was replaced by Fab-8. Thus, boundaries perform two opposite functions in the context of BX-C – they block crosstalk between neighboring regulatory domains, but at the same time actively facilitate long distance communication between the regulatory domains and their respective target genes.}},

Chromosome conformation capture revealed that mammalian chromosomes possess a rich hierarchy of structural layers, from multi-megabase compartments to sub-megabase topologically associating domains (TADs) and sub-TAD contact domains. TADs appear to act as regulatory microenvironments by constraining and segregating regulatory interactions across discrete chromosomal regions. However, it is unclear whether other (or all) folding layers share similar properties, or rather TADs constitute a privileged folding scale with maximal impact on the organization of regulatory interactions. Here, we present a novel algorithm named CaTCH that identifies hierarchical trees of chromosomal domains in Hi-C maps, stratified through their reciprocal physical insulation, which is a single and biologically relevant parameter. By applying CaTCH to published Hi-C data sets, we show that previously reported folding layers appear at different insulation levels. We demonstrate that although no structurally privileged folding level exists, TADs emerge as a functionally privileged scale defined by maximal boundary enrichment in CTCF and maximal cell-type conservation. By measuring transcriptional output in embryonic stem cells and neural precursor cells, we show that the likelihood that genes in a domain are coregulated during differentiation is also maximized at the scale of TADs. Finally, we observe that regulatory sequences occur at genomic locations corresponding to optimized mutual interactions at the same scale. Our analysis suggests that the architectural functionality of TADs arises from the interplay between their ability to partition interactions and the specific genomic position of regulatory sequences.}},

Next-generation sequencing has enabled the rapid generation of genomic data that predict the locations of CREs, but a bottleneck lies in functionally interpreting these data. To address this issue, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) have emerged, in which barcoded reporter libraries are introduced into cells and the resulting barcoded transcripts are quantified by next-generation sequencing. Thus far, MPRAs have been largely restricted to assaying short CREs in a limited repertoire of cultured cell types. Here, we present two advances that extend the biological relevance and applicability of MPRAs. First, we adapt exome capture technology to instead capture candidate CREs, thereby tiling across the targeted regions and markedly increasing the length of candidate CREs that can be readily assayed. Second, we package the library into adeno-associated virus (AAV), thereby allowing delivery of candidate CREs to target organs in vivo. As a proof-of-concept, we introduce a capture library of \textbackslashtextasciitilde46,000 constructs, corresponding to \textbackslashtextasciitilde3,500 DNase I hypersensitive (DHS) sites, into the mouse retina by ex vivo plasmid electroporation and into the mouse cerebral cortex by in vivo AAV injection. We demonstrate tissue-specific cis-regulatory activity of DHSs and provide examples of high-resolution truncation mutation analysis for multiplex parsing of CREs.

  abstract = {{Many proteins regulate the expression of genes by binding to specific regions encoded in the genome1. Here we introduce a new data set of RNA elements in the human genome that are recognized by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), generated as part of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project phase III. This class of regulatory elements functions only when transcribed into RNA, as they serve as the binding sites for RBPs that control post-transcriptional processes such as splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, and the editing, localization, stability and translation of mRNAs. We describe the mapping and characterization of RNA elements recognized by a large collection of human RBPs in K562 and HepG2 cells. Integrative analyses using five assays identify RBP binding sites on RNA and chromatin in vivo, the in vitro binding preferences of RBPs, the function of RBP binding sites and the subcellular localization of RBPs, producing 1,223 replicated data sets for 356 RBPs. We describe the spectrum of RBP binding throughout the transcriptome and the connections between these interactions and various aspects of RNA biology, including RNA stability, splicing regulation and RNA localization. These data expand the catalogue of functional elements encoded in the human genome by the addition of a large set of elements that function at the RNA level by interacting with RBPs. A combination of five assays is used to produce a catalogue of RNA elements to which RNA-binding proteins bind in human cells.}},

  doi = {10.1261/rna.053959.115}, 
  abstract = {{RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%-40\% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to >85\% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve >85\% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.}},

We have used a combination of maximum-likelihood phylogenetic inference and independent, comprehensive functional assays of DNA-binding capacity to explore the evolution of DNA-binding specificity within the forkhead family. We present converging evidence that similar alternative sequence preferences have arisen repeatedly and independently in the course of forkhead evolution. The vast majority of DNA-binding specificity changes we observed are not explained by alterations in the known DNA-contacting amino acid residues conferring specificity for canonical forkhead binding sites. Intriguingly, we have found forkhead DBDs that retain the ability to bind very specifically to two completely distinct DNA sequence motifs. We propose an alternate specificity-determining mechanism whereby conformational rearrangements of the DBD broaden the spectrum of sequence motifs that a TF can recognize. DNA-binding bispecificity suggests a previously undescribed source of modularity and flexibility in gene regulation and may play an important role in the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks.}},

Both cis- and trans-regulatory changes contribute to divergent gene expression, but their respective contributions remain largely unknown3. Here we examine the distribution of cis- and trans-regulatory changes underlying expression differences between closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans, and show functional cis-regulatory differences by comparing the relative abundance of species-specific transcripts in F1 hybrids4,5. Differences in trans-regulatory activity were inferred by comparing the ratio of allelic expression in hybrids with the ratio of gene expression between species. Of 29 genes with interspecific expression differences, 28 had differences in cis-regulation, and these changes were sufficient to explain expression divergence for about half of the genes. Trans-regulatory differences affected 55\% (16 of 29) of genes, and were always accompanied by cis-regulatory changes. These data indicate that interspecific expression differences are not caused by select trans-regulatory changes with widespread effects, but rather by many cis-acting changes spread throughout the genome.}},

  title = {{Robust hyperparameter estimation protects against hypervariable genes and improves power to detect differential expression}}, 
  abstract = {{One of the most common analysis tasks in genomic research is to identify genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between experimental conditions. Empirical Bayes (EB) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological replicate samples is small. The EB procedures can however be heavily influenced by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be spuriously identified as DE while increasing statistical power for the main body of genes. The robust EB algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics and reduces exactly to the original EB procedure when no outlier genes are present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.}},

To support comparative genomics, we filled in divergence gaps in the Drosophila phylogeny by generating draft genomes for eight new species. For comparative transcriptome analysis, we generated mRNA expression profiles on 81 samples from multiple tissues and developmental stages of 15 Drosophila species, and we performed cap analysis of gene expression in D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. We also describe conservation of four distinct core promoter structures composed of combinations of elements at three positions. Overall, each type of genomic feature shows a characteristic divergence rate relative to neutral models, highlighting the value of multispecies alignment in annotating a target genome that should prove useful in the annotation of other high priority genomes, especially human and other mammalian genomes that are rich in noncoding sequences. We report that the vast majority of elements in the annotation are evolutionarily conserved, indicating that the annotation will be an important springboard for functional genetic testing by the Drosophila community.}},

Integration of epigenomic data from these organisms revealed that histone H3 trimethylation (H3K4me3) was largely confined to TSSs of stable transcripts, whereas H3K27ac marked nucleosomes downstream from all active TSSs, suggesting an ancient role for posttranslational histone modifications in transcription.

Bioinformatic analyses of core promoter sequences from 190 genes that are specifically expressed in testes identified a 10 bp A/T-rich motif that is identical to the translational control element (TCE). The TCE functions in the 5' untranslated region of Mst(3)CGP mRNAs to repress translation, and it also functions in a heterologous gene to regulate transcription. We found that among genes with focused initiation patterns, the TCE is significantly enriched in core promoters of genes that are specifically expressed in testes but not in core promoters of genes that are specifically expressed in other tissues. The TCE is variably located in core promoters and is conserved in melanogaster subgroup species, but conservation dramatically drops in more distant species. In transgenic flies, short (300-400 bp) genomic regions containing a TCE directed testis-specific transcription of a reporter gene. Mutation of the TCE significantly reduced but did not abolish reporter gene transcription indicating that the TCE is important but not essential for transcription activation. Finally, mutation of testis-specific TFIID (tTFIID) subunits significantly reduced the transcription of a subset of endogenous TCE-containing but not TCE-lacking genes, suggesting that tTFIID activity is limited to TCE-containing genes but that tTFIID is not an obligatory regulator of TCE-containing genes. Thus, the TCE is a core promoter element in a subset of genes that are specifically expressed in testes. Furthermore, the TCE regulates transcription in the context of short genomic regions, from variable locations in the core promoter, and both dependently and independently of tTFIID. These findings set the stage for determining the mechanism by which the TCE regulates testis-specific transcription and understanding the dual role of the TCE in translational and transcriptional regulation.}},

Recent genome-wide ribosome profiling studies suggest that thousands of uORFs initiate with non-AUG start codons. While intriguing, these non-AUG uORF predictions have been made without statistical control or validation, thus the importance of these elements remains to be demonstrated. To address this, we took a comparative genomics approach to study AUG and non-AUG uORFs. We mapped transcription leaders in multiple Saccharomyces yeast species and applied a novel machine learning algorithm (uORF-seqr) to ribosome profiling data to identify statistically significant uORFs. We found that AUG and non-AUG uORFs are equally frequent in Saccharomyces yeasts. Although most non-AUG uORFs are found in only one species, hundreds have either conserved sequence or position within Saccharomyces. uORFs initiating with UUG are particularly common, and are shared between species at rates similar to that of AUG uORFs. However, non-AUG uORFs are translated less efficiently than AUG-uORFs and are less subject to removal via alternative transcription initiation under normal growth conditions. These results suggest that a subset of non-AUG uORFs may play important roles in regulating gene expression.}},

  abstract = {{Author Summary The removal of deleterious mutations from natural populations has potential consequences on patterns of variation across genomes. Population genetic analyses, however, often assume that such effects are negligible across recombining regions of species like Drosophila . We use simple models of purifying selection and current knowledge of recombination rates and gene distribution across the genome to obtain a baseline of variation predicted by the constant input and removal of deleterious mutations. We find that purifying selection alone can explain a major fraction of the observed variance in nucleotide diversity across the genome. The use of a baseline of variation predicted by linkage to deleterious mutations as null expectation exposes genomic regions under other selective regimes, including more regions showing the signature of balancing selection than would be evident when using traditional approaches. Our study also indicates that most, if not all, nucleotides across the D. melanogas ter genome are significantly influenced by the removal of deleterious mutations, even when located in the middle of highly recombining regions and distant from genes. Additionally, the study of rates of protein evolution confirms previous analyses suggesting that the recombination landscape across the genome has changed in the recent history of D. melanogaster . All these reported factors can skew current analyses designed to capture demographic events or estimate the strength and frequency of adaptive mutations, and illustrate the need for new and more realistic theoretical and modeling approaches to study naturally occurring genetic variation.}},

Multiple inducible gene overexpression systems have been developed for plants, but very few of these combine plant selection markers, control of expression domains, access to multiple promoters and protein fusion reporters, chemical induction, and high-throughput cloning capabilities. Here, we introduce a MultiSite Gateway® compatible inducible system for plants that provides the capability to generate such constructs in a single cloning step. The system is based on the tightly controlled, estrogen-inducible XVE system. We demonstrate that the transformants generated with this system exhibit expected cell-type specific expression, similar to what is observed with constitutively-expressed native promoters. With this new system, cloning of inducible constructs is no longer limited to a few special cases, but can be used as standard approach when gene function is studied. In addition, we present a set of entry clones consisting of histochemical and fluorescent reporter variants designed for gene and promoter expression studies.}},

  abstract = {{Combining ancestral protein reconstruction with deep mutational scanning to characterize alternative histories in the sequence space around an ancient transcription factor reveals hundreds of alternative protein sequences that use diverse biochemical mechanisms to perform the derived function at least as well as the historical outcome. Whether history could have turned out otherwise is the core question in countless 'what if' stories, which remain vastly speculative because of experimental inaccessibility. By focusing on DNA-binding specificity in a well-characterized ancestral hormone receptor, Joe Thornton and colleagues have mapped the immense set of evolutionary paths that the protein could have taken. Through deep mutational scanning of half a million reconstructed variants, they find hundreds of alternative protein sequences that rely on a rich diversity of biophysical solutions to perform the derived function as well as, or better than, the historical evolutionary outcome. The results illustrate that the biological reality we live in is just the outcome from one of many rolls of the evolutionary dice, and that things probably turned out as they did for no particular reason. To understand why molecular evolution turned out as it did, we must characterize not only the path that evolution followed across the space of possible molecular sequences but also the many alternative trajectories that could have been taken but were not. A large-scale comparison of real and possible histories would establish whether the outcome of evolution represents an optimal state driven by natural selection or the contingent product of historical chance events1; it would also reveal how the underlying distribution of functions across sequence space shaped historical evolution2,3. Here we combine ancestral protein reconstruction4 with deep mutational scanning5,6,7,8,9,10 to characterize alternative histories in the sequence space around an ancient transcription factor, which evolved a novel biological function through well-characterized mechanisms11,12. We find hundreds of alternative protein sequences that use diverse biochemical mechanisms to perform the derived function at least as well as the historical outcome. These alternatives all require prior permissive substitutions that do not enhance the derived function, but not all require the same permissive changes that occurred during history. We find that if evolution had begun from a different starting point within the network of sequences encoding the ancestral function, outcomes with different genetic and biochemical forms would probably have resulted; this contingency arises from the distribution of functional variants in sequence space and epistasis between residues. Our results illuminate the topology of the vast space of possibilities from which history sampled one path, highlighting how the outcome of evolution depends on a serial chain of compounding chance events.}},

Since the emergence of high-throughput techniques like ChIP-seq, ChIP-exo and protein-binding microarrays (PBMs), the focus of de novo motif discovery has shifted to runtime and accuracy on large data sets. For this purpose, specialized algorithms have been designed for discovering motifs in ChIP-seq or PBM data. However, none of the existing approaches work perfectly for all three high-throughput techniques. In this article, we propose Dimont, a general approach for fast and accurate de novo motif discovery from high-throughput data. We demonstrate that Dimont yields a higher number of correct motifs from ChIP-seq data than any of the specialized approaches and achieves a higher accuracy for predicting PBM intensities from probe sequence than any of the approaches specifically designed for that purpose. Dimont also reports the expected motifs for several ChIP-exo data sets. Investigating differences between in vitro and in vivo binding, we find that for most transcription factors, the motifs discovered by Dimont are in good accordance between techniques, but we also find notable exceptions. We also observe that modeling intra-motif dependencies may increase accuracy, which indicates that more complex motif models are a worthwhile field of research.}},

  abstract = {{The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates. For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous regulatory mutation. Sidow 1996(p. 717) On one hand, it may fix an advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable, function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively, a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a pseudogene. Walsh 1995 (p. 426) Duplicated genes persist only if mutations create new and essential protein functions, an event that is predicted to occur rarely. Nadeau and Sankoff 1997 (p. 1259) Thus overall, with complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention of ancient gene duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition of novel expression sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying opportunity for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension of development itself.

  abstract = {{Author summary Genetically identical cells, even when they are exposed to the same environmental conditions, display incredible diversity. Gene expression noise is attributed to be a key source of this phenotypic diversity. Transcriptional dynamics is a dominant source of expression noise. Although scores of theoretical and experimental studies have explored how noise is regulated at the level of transcription, most of them focus on the gene specific, cis regulatory elements, such as the number of transcription factor (TF) binding sites, their binding strength, etc. However, how the global properties of transcription, such as the limited availability of TFs impact noise in gene expression remains rather elusive. Here we build a theoretical model that incorporates the effect of limiting TF pool on gene expression noise. We find that competition between genes for TFs leads to enhanced variability in mRNA copy number across an isogenic population. Moreover, for gene copies sharing TFs with other competitor sites, mRNA variance as a function of the mean shows distinct imprints for one gene copy and multiple gene copies respectively. This stands in sharp contrast to the universal behavior found in mean expression irrespective of the different scenarios of competition. An interesting feature of competition is that introduction of competitor sites can transform a unimodal mRNA distribution into a multimodal distribution, which could lead to phenotypic variability.}},

This error hypothesis predicts that (i) the TSS diversity of a gene reduces with its expression level; (ii) the fractional use of the major TSS increases, but that of each minor TSS decreases, with the gene expression level; and (iii) cis-elements for major TSSs are selectively constrained, while those for minor TSSs are not. By contrast, the adaptive hypothesis does not make these predictions a priori. Our analysis of human and mouse transcriptomes confirms each of the three predictions. These and other findings strongly suggest that ATI predominantly results from molecular errors, requiring a major revision of our understanding of the precision and regulation of transcription.}},

The synthetic juvenoids pyriproxyfen and fenoxycarb mimic the action of methyl farnesoate in daphnids. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that juvenoids also can regulate ecdysteroid activity in a crustacean (Daphnia magna). Methyl farnesoate, pyriproxyfen, and fenoxycarb all disrupted ecdysteroid-regulated aspects of embryo development in daphnids. Exposure of ecdysteroid-responsive cells to 20-hydroxyecdysone reduced cell proliferation and increased mRNA levels of the ecdysone receptor and its partner protein ultraspiracle. Co-treatment of cells with the juvenoid pyriproxyfen attenuated all of these ecdysteroid mediated responses. While juvenoids functioned as anti-ecdysteroids in both intact embryos and in cultured cells, 20-hydroxyecdysone showed no evidence of acting as an anti-juvenoid. The combined effects of pyroproxyfen with the ecdysteroid synthesis inhibitor fenarimol and the ecdysteroid receptor antagonist testosterone were evaluated in an effort to discern whether the action of the juvenoids were additive with those of know anti-ecdysteroids. The anti-ecdysteroid effects of pyriproxyfen were non-additive with those of either anti-ecdysteroid. Rather, joint effects conformed to a model of synergy. These results demonstrated that juvenoids elicit anti-ecdysteroidal activity in a crustacean through a unique mechanism of action. A model involving receptor partner deprivation is proposed that explains the synergistic interactions observed.}},

However, few studies have been conducted to identify and characterize its transcription start sites (TSSs) and promoters at the genome-wide level. Here, using TSS-seq, we identified TSSs at the genome-wide scale and characterized promoters in C. intestinalis. Specifically, we identified TSS clusters (TSCs), high-density regions of TSS-seq tags, each of which appears to originate from an identical promoter. TSCs were found not only at known TSSs but also in other regions, suggesting the existence of many unknown transcription units in the genome. We also identified candidate promoters of 79 ribosomal protein (RP) genes, each of which had the major TSS in a polypyrimidine tract and showed a sharp TSS distribution like human RP gene promoters. Ciona RP gene promoters, however, did not appear to have typical TATA boxes, unlike human RP gene promoters. In Ciona non-RP promoters, two pyrimidine-purine dinucleotides, CA and TA, were frequently used as TSSs. Despite the absence of CpG islands, Ciona TATA-less promoters showed low expression specificity like CpG-associated human TATA-less promoters. By using TSS-seq, we also predicted trans-spliced gene TSSs and found that their downstream regions had higher G+T content than those of non-trans-spliced gene TSSs. Furthermore, we identified many putative alternative promoters, some of which were regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Our results provide valuable information about TSSs and promoter characteristics in C. intestinalis and will be helpful in future analysis of transcriptional regulation in chordates.}},

There is a significant excess of retrogenes that originate from the X chromosome and retropose to autosomes; new genes retroposed from autosomes are scarce. Further, we found that most of these X-derived autosomal retrogenes had evolved a testis expression pattern.

  abstract = {{Abstract Core promoter types differ in the extent to which RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pauses after initiation, but how this difference affects their tissue-specific gene expression characteristics is not well understood. While promoters with Pol II pausing elements are active at all stages of development, TATA promoters are highly active in differentiated tissues. We therefore used a genomics approach on late-stage Drosophila embryos to analyze the properties of promoter types. Using tissue-specific Pol II ChIP-seq, we found that paused promoters have high levels of paused Pol II throughout the embryo, even in tissues where the gene is not expressed, while TATA promoters only show Pol II occupancy when the gene is active. This difference between promoter types is associated with different chromatin accessibility in ATAC-seq data and different expression characteristics in single-cell RNA data. The results suggest that promoter types have optimized different promoter properties: paused promoters show more consistent expression when active, while TATA promoters have lower background expression when inactive. We propose that tissue-specific effector genes have evolved to use two different strategies for their differential expression across tissues.}}

Although previous studies have investigated different gene-age related signatures, what signatures dominantly associate with gene age remains unresolved. Here we address this question via a combined approach of comprehensive assignment of gene ages, gene family identification, and multivariate analyses. We first provide a comprehensive and improved gene age assignment by combining homolog clustering with phylogeny inference and categorize human genes into 26 age classes spanning the whole tree of life. We then explore the dominant age-related signatures based on a collection of 10 potential signatures (including gene composition, gene length, selection pressure, expression level, connectivity in protein-protein interaction network and DNA methylation). Our results show that GC content and connectivity in protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) associate dominantly with gene age. Furthermore, we investigate the heterogeneity of dominant signatures in duplicates and singletons. We find that GC content is a consistent primary factor of gene age in duplicates and singletons, whereas PPIN is more strongly associated with gene age in singletons than in duplicates. Taken together, GC content and PPIN are two dominant signatures in close association with gene age, exhibiting heterogeneity in duplicates and singletons and presumably reflecting complex differential interplays between natural selection and mutation.}},

However, a set of genes escapes global repression and gets activated before MBT. Here we describe the formation and the spatio-temporal dynamics of a pair of distinct transcription compartments, which encompasses the earliest gene expression in zebrafish. 4D imaging of pri-miR430 and zinc-finger-gene activities by a novel, native transcription imaging approach reveals transcriptional sharing of nuclear compartments, which are regulated by homologous chromosome organisation. These compartments carry the majority of nascent-RNAs and active Polymerase II, are chromatin-depleted and represent the main sites of detectable transcription before MBT. Transcription occurs during the S-phase of increasingly permissive cleavage cycles. It is proposed, that the transcription compartment is part of the regulatory architecture of embryonic nuclei and offers a transcriptionally competent environment to facilitate early escape from repression before global genome activation.}},

  abstract = {{Histone modifications are frequently used as markers for enhancer states, but how to interpret enhancer states in the context of embryonic development is not clear. The poised enhancer signature, involving H3K4me1 and low levels of H3K27ac, has been reported to mark inactive enhancers that are poised for future activation. However, future activation is not always observed, and alternative reasons for the widespread occurrence of this enhancer signature have not been investigated. By analyzing enhancers during dorsal-ventral (DV) axis formation in the Drosophila embryo, we find that the poised enhancer signature is specifically generated during patterning in the tissue where the enhancers are not induced, including at enhancers that are known to be repressed by a transcriptional repressor. These results suggest that, rather than serving exclusively as an intermediate step before future activation, the poised enhancer state may be a mark for spatial regulation during tissue patterning. We discuss the possibility that the poised enhancer state is more generally the result of repression by transcriptional repressors.}},

Although Spt6 is viewed as an elongation factor, spt6 mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae allow elevated levels of transcripts from within coding regions, suggesting that Spt6 also controls initiation. To address the requirements for Spt6 in transcription and chromatin structure, we have combined four genome-wide approaches. Our results demonstrate that Spt6 represses transcription initiation at thousands of intragenic promoters. We characterize these intragenic promoters and find sequence features conserved with genic promoters. Finally, we show that Spt6 also regulates transcription initiation at most genic promoters and propose a model of initiation site competition to account for this. Together, our results demonstrate that Spt6 controls the fidelity of transcription initiation throughout the genome. Doris et al. show that Spt6, a conserved transcription factor, is broadly required for the accuracy of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. In the absence of Spt6, transcription initiates at thousands of new sites, likely due to the presence of specific sequence features along with changes in chromatin structure.}},

Regulatory variation between individuals is lower in iPSCs than in the differentiated cell types, consistent with the intuition that developmental processes are generally canalized. While most cell type-specific regulatory quantitative trait loci (QTLs) lie in chromatin that is open only in the affected cell types, we found that 20\% of cell type-specific QTLs are in shared open chromatin. Finally, we developed a deep neural network to predict open chromatin regions from DNA sequence alone and were able to use the sequences of segregating haplotypes to predict the effects of common SNPs on cell type-specific chromatin accessibility.}},

Plant Fe deficiency (-Fe) activates a complex regulatory network which coordinates root Fe uptake and distribution to sink tissues, while avoiding over-accumulation of Fe and other metals to toxic levels. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), FIT (FER-LIKE FE DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR), a bHLH transcription factor (TF), is required for up-regulation of root Fe acquisition genes. However, other root and shoot -Fe-induced genes involved in Fe allocation and signaling are FIT-independent. The cis-regulatory code, i.e. the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and their combinations that regulate plant -Fe-responses, remains largely elusive. Using Arabidopsis genome and transcriptome data, we identified over 100 putative CREs (pCREs) that were predictive of -Fe-induced up-regulation of genes in root tissue. We used large-scale in vitro TF binding data, association with FIT-dependent or FIT-independent co-expression clusters, positional bias, and evolutionary conservation to assess pCRE properties and possible functions. In addition to bHLH and MYB TFs, also B3, NAC, bZIP, and TCP TFs might be important regulators for -Fe responses. Our approach uncovered IDE1 (Iron Deficiency-responsive Element 1), a Fe response CRE in grass species, to be conserved in regulating genes for biosynthesis of Fe-chelating compounds also in Arabidopsis. Our findings provide a comprehensive source of cis-regulatory information for -Fe-responsive genes, that advances our mechanistic understanding and informs future efforts in engineering plants with more efficient Fe uptake or transport systems.</p>}},

  abstract = {{Estrogen biosynthesis in adipose tissue has assumed great significance in terms of a number of estrogen-related diseases. Recent evidence suggests that estrogen synthesized locally in the breast is of singular significance in the development of breast cancer in elderly women. The biosynthesis of estrogen from C19 steroids is catalyzed by a specific form of cytochrome P450, namely aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450arom; the product of the CYP19 gene). The human CYP19 gene comprises nine coding exons, II-X, and its transcripts are expressed in the ovary, placenta, testes, adipose tissue, and brain. Tissue-specific expression of the CYP19 gene is determined, at least in part, by the use of tissue-specific promoters, which give rise to transcripts with unique 5'-noncoding termini. Transcripts in adipose tissue contain 5'-termini derived from specific untranslated exons, corresponding to expression derived from the proximal promoter II and its splice variant I.3, as well as a distal promoter, I.4. The object of the present study was to determine the distribution of these various exon-specific transcripts in breast adipose tissues from cancer-free women undergoing reduction mammoplasty and from patients with breast cancer, because this would provide important clues as to the nature of the factors regulating aromatase expression in these sites. To achieve this, we employed competitive RT-PCR, utilizing an internal standard for each exon-specific transcript of the CYP19 gene, as well as for the coding region, to evaluate total CYP19 gene transcripts. In cancer patients (n = 18), total CYP19 gene transcript levels were significantly higher in adipose tissue proximal to a tumor in comparison with adipose tissue distal to a tumor, in agreement with previous findings. Moreover, total transcript levels were higher in breast adipose tissue of cancer patients in comparison with those of cancer-free individuals (n = 9), even when the adipose tissue from the cancer patient was taken from a quadrant with no detectable tumor. We observed that exon I.4-specific transcripts were predominant in breast adipose obtained from cancer-free women. In this tissue, promoter-II-specific and exon I.3-specific transcripts were present in low copy number. On the other hand, in breast cancer patients, CYP19 gene transcripts from breast adipose tissue had primarily promoter-II-specific and exon I.3-specific sequence, whereas comparatively few transcripts had exon I.4-specific sequence at the 5'-terminus. We conclude that CYP19 gene transcription in breast adipose tissue of cancer-free individuals uses preferably promoter I.4, implicating a role of glucocorticoids and members of the IL-6 cytokine family in the regulation of this expression. On the other hand, the increased expression in breast adipose tissue bearing a carcinoma results from expression from promoters II and I.3, which are regulated by unknown factors acting via increased cAMP formation, which are presumably secreted by the tumor or associated cells.}},

As expected, we found these promoters varied in their expression level under activated and repressed conditions as well as in their dynamic response following loss of glucose repression. Despite these differences, only a single promoter driving near basal levels of expression caused a detectable loss of fitness.

  abstract = {{The core promoter, a stretch of DNA surrounding the transcription start site (TSS) is a major integration point for regulatory signals controlling gene transcription. The process of cell differentiation is accompanied by a marked divergence in transcriptional repertoire between cells of different fates, accompanied by changes in cellular behaviour, in particular their proliferative activity. Investigation of divergent core promoter architectures suggest distinct regulatory networks act on the core promoter, modulating cell behavior through transcriptional profile changes, which ultimately drives key transitions in cellular behaviour during embryonic development. The role that promoter-associated gene regulatory networks play in development associated transitions in cell cycle dynamics (e.g. during differentiation) however, is poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate in a developing in vivo model, how core promoter variations play a key role in defining transcriptional output in cells transitioning from a proliferative to cell-lineage specifying phenotype. The FUCCI transgenic system, differentially marks cells in G1 and S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle and can therefore be used to separate rapidly and slowly cycling cells in vivo , by virtue of the cell cycle stage they primarily inhabit. Longitudinal assessment of cell proliferation rate during zebrafish embryo development, using this system, revealed a spatial and lineage-specific separation in cell cycling behaviour across post-gastrulation embryos. In order to investigate the role differential promoter usage plays in this process, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) was performed on fluorescent associated cell sorted (FACS) FUCCI zebrafish embryos going through somitogenesis, separating cells in accordance with the rate of their cell cycling. This analysis revealed a dramatic increase in lineage and tissue-specific gene expression, concurrent with a slowing of their cell cycling. Core promoters associated with rapidly cycling cells, showed broad distribution of transcription start site usage, featuring positionally constrained CCAAT-box, while slowly cycling cells favoured sharp TSS usage coupled with canonical TATA-box utilisation and enrichment of Sp1 binding sites. These results demonstrate the regulatory role of core promoters in cell cycle-dependent transcription regulation, during somitogenesis stages of embryo development.}},

Deletion of CTCF binding sites within the Hox clusters results in the expansion of active chromatin into the repressive domain. CTCF functions as an insulator by organizing Hox clusters into spatially disjoint domains. Ablation of CTCF binding disrupts topological boundaries such that caudal Hox genes leave the repressed domain and become subject to transcriptional activation.

For most CGI-associated promoters, Pol II exhibits a dominant pause at either the promoter-proximal or this distal site that correlates, both in position and in intensity, with local regions of high GC skew, a sequence feature known to form unique secondary structures. Upon signal-induced gene activation, long-range enhancer contacts at the dominant pause site are selectively enhanced, suggesting a new role for enhancers at the downstream pause.

It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.}},

Using only allele frequency information from the complete low coverage 1000 Genomes Project dataset in conjunction with a support vector machine trained from known functional and non-functional portions of the genome, we are able to accurately identify portions of the genome constrained by purifying selection.

Candidate targets for gain and loss of function along the human lineage include numerous putative regulatory regions of genes essential for normal development of the central nervous system, including a significant enrichment of gain of function events near neurotransmitter receptor genes. These results are consistent with regulatory turnover being a key mechanism in the evolution of human-specific characteristics of brain development.

Here we present a comparative analysis of promoters' sequence composition and chromatin architecture in five eukaryotic model organisms, which shows the presence of common and unique DNA encoded features used to organize chromatin. Analysis of Pol II initiation patterns uncovers that, in the absence of certain CPEs, there is a strong correlation between the spread of initiation and the intensity of the 10 bp periodic signal in the nearest downstream nucleosome. Moreover, promoters' primary and secondary initiation sites show a characteristic 10 bp periodicity in the absence of CPEs. We also show that DNA natural variants in the region immediately downstream the TSS are able to affect both the nucleosome DNA affinity and Pol-II initiation pattern. These findings support the notion that, in addition to CPEs mediated selection, sequence induced nucleosome positioning could be a common and conserved mechanism of TSS selection in animals.}},

The aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of using RNA-sequencing data to improve binding motif prediction accuracy. Publicly available GRID-seq scores and computed DeepBind scores could be aggregated by chromosomal region and anomalies within the aggregated data could be detected using mahalanobis distance analysis. A mantel’s test of matrices containing pairwise hamming distances showed significant differences between 1) randomly ranked sequences, 2) sequences ranked by non-GRID-seq assisted scores, and 3) sequences ranked by GRID-seq assisted scores. Plots of mahalanobis ranked binding motifs revealed an inversely proportional relationship between GRID-seq scores and DeepBind scores. Data points with high DeepBind scores but low GRID-seq scores had no DNAse hypersensitivity clusters annotated to their respective sequences. However, DNase hypersensitivity was observed for high scoring DeepBind motifs with moderate GRID-seq scores. Binding motifs of interest were recognized by their deviance from the inversely proportional tendency, and the underlying context sequences of these predicted motifs were on occasion associated with DNAse hypersensitivity unlike the most highly ranked motif scores when DeepBind was used in isolation. This article presents a novel combinatory approach to predict functional protein-chromosomal binding motifs. The two underlying methods are based on recent developments in the fields of RNA sequencing and deep learning, respectively.

  abstract = {{Promoters are central to the regulation of gene expression. Changes in gene regulation are thought to underlie much of the adaptive diversification between species and phenotypic variation within populations. In contrast to earlier work emphasizing the importance of enhancer evolution and subtle sequence changes at promoters, we show that dramatic changes such as the complete gain and loss (collectively, turnover) of functional promoters are common. Using quantitative measures of transcription initiation in both humans and mice across 52 matched tissues, we discriminate promoter sequence gains from losses and resolve the lineage of changes. We also identify expression divergence and functional turnover between orthologous promoters, finding only the latter is associated with local sequence changes. Promoter turnover has occurred at the majority (>56\%) of protein-coding genes since humans and mice diverged. Tissue-restricted promoters are the most evolutionarily volatile where retrotransposition is an important, but not the sole, source of innovation. There is considerable heterogeneity of turnover rates between promoters in different tissues, but the consistency of these in both lineages suggests that the same biological systems are similarly inclined to transcriptional rewiring. The genes affected by promoter turnover show evidence of adaptive evolution. In mice, promoters are primarily lost through deletion of the promoter containing sequence, whereas in humans, many promoters appear to be gradually decaying with weak transcriptional output and relaxed selective constraint. Our results suggest that promoter gain and loss is an important process in the evolutionary rewiring of gene regulation and may be a significant source of phenotypic diversification.}},

However, these studies do not account for the likely effects of distant enhancers or chromatin structure, and thus it is difficult to conclude that the sequence variation in proximal promoters acts to modulate transcription in the natural context of the whole genome. This problem, the biological importance of proximal promoter sequence variation, can be addressed using a combination of molecular and evolutionary analyses. Provided here are molecular and evolutionary analyses of the variation in promoter function and sequence within and between populations of Fundulus heteroclitus for the lactate dehydrogenase-B (Ldh-B) proximal promoter. Approximately one third of the Ldh-B proximal promoter contains interspersed regions that are functionally important: (1) they bind transcription factors in vivo, (2) they effect a change in transcription as assayed by transient transfection into two different fish cell lines, and (3) they bind purified transcription factors in vitro. Evolutionary analyses that compare sequence variation in these functional regions versus the nonfunctional regions indicate that the changes in the Ldh-B proximal promoter sequences are due to directional selection. Thus, the Ldh-B proximal promoter sequence variations that affect transcriptional processes constitute a phenotypic change that is subject to natural selection, suggesting that proximal promoter sequence variation affects transcription in the natural context of the whole genome.}},

RAMPAGE allows for highly stringent selection of 5'-complete molecules, thus allowing base-resolution TSS identification with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Paired-end sequencing of medium-length cDNAs yields transcript structure information that is essential to interpreting the relationship of TSSs to annotated genes and transcripts. As opposed to standard RNA-seq, RAMPAGE explicitly yields accurate and highly reproducible expression level estimates for individual promoters. Moreover, this approach offers a streamlined 2- to 3-day protocol that is optimized for extensive sample multiplexing, and is therefore adapted for large-scale projects.

Phosphorylation of Ser5 and Ser7 by cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) as part of TFIIH marks initiation, whereas phosphorylation of Ser2 by CDK9 marks elongation. These processes are thought to take place in localized transcription foci in the nucleus, known as "transcription factories," but it has been argued that the observed clusters/foci are mere fixation or labeling artifacts. We show that transcription factories exist in living cells as distinct foci by live-imaging fluorescently labeled CDK9, a kinase known to associate with active RNAPII. These foci were observed in different cell types derived from CDK9-mCherry knock-in mice. We show that these foci are very stable while highly dynamic in exchanging CDK9. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) data show that the genome-wide binding sites of CDK9 and initiating RNAPII overlap on transcribed genes. Immunostaining shows that CDK9-mCherry foci colocalize with RNAPII-Ser5P, much less with RNAPII-Ser2P, and not with CDK12 (a kinase reported to be involved in the Ser2 phosphorylation) or with splicing factor SC35. In conclusion, transcription factories exist in living cells, and initiation and elongation of transcripts takes place in different nuclear compartments.}},

The results reveal different requirements at different genomic scales. Transcription is generally not required for higher-level genome compartmentalization, has only moderate effects on domain organization and is not sufficient to create new domain boundaries. However, on a finer scale, transcripts or transcription does seem to have a role in the formation of subcompartments and subdomains and in stabilizing enhancer–promoter interactions.

PROMPTs are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. Similarly, active enhancer regions in animals initiate transcription of exosome-sensitive enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Previous studies based on nascent RNA approaches concluded that Arabidopsis thaliana does not produce PROMPTs. Here, we used steady-state RNA sequencing methods in mutants defective in nuclear RNA decay, including by the exosome, to reassess the existence of PROMPTs and eRNAs in A. thaliana. While PROMPTs are overall rare in A. thaliana, about 100 clear cases of exosome-sensitive PROMPTs and 113 loci producing eRNA-like transcripts were identified. In addition, we found \textbackslashtextasciitilde200 transcription start sites within 39-UTR-encoding regions that produce unspliced exosome-sensitive antisense RNAs covering much of the cognate pre-mRNA. A typical representative of this class of RNAs is the previously characterized non-coding RNA controlling the expression of the key seed dormancy regulator, DELAY OF GERMINATION1. Exosome-sensitive antisense RNAs are overrepresented in transcription factor genes, suggesting a potential for widespread control of gene expression.

Conversely, in cancer and autism patients, we observed an enrichment of penetrance increasing haplotype configurations for pathogenic variants in disease-implicated genes, providing evidence that regulatory haplotype configuration of coding variants affects disease risk. Finally, we experimentally validated this model by editing a Mendelian single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using CRISPR/Cas9 on distinct expression haplotypes with the transcriptome as a phenotypic readout.

This effect of introns on growth is not linked to the expression of the host gene, and was reproduced even when translation of the host mRNA was blocked. Transcriptomic and genetic analyses indicate that introns promote resistance to starvation by enhancing the repression of ribosomal protein genes that are downstream of the nutrient-sensing TORC1 and PKA pathways.

In the present work we started from the working hypothesis that states that “it is possible to predict the function starting solely from sequence information through the determination of structure based chemical reactivity patterns related to oxygen reactivity” and predicted oxygen reactivity for over 1000 truncated hemoglobins and analyzed the results in an evolutionary context. Our results taught us many interesting and novel features of these proteins, underscoring flexibility and adaptability of the globin fold. The work also shows that it is possible to characterize protein function in greater detail if specific sequence-to-function bridges are built upon a solid structural basis.}},

Data imputation approaches that aim to estimate missing regulatory signals have been applied before genome segmentation. However, this approach is computationally costly and propagates any errors in imputation to produce incorrect genome segmentation results downstream. We present an extension to the IDEAS genome segmentation platform which can perform genome segmentation on incomplete regulatory genomics dataset collections without using imputation. Instead of relying on imputed data, we use an expectation-maximization approach to estimate marginal density functions within each regulatory state. We demonstrate that our genome segmentation results compare favorably with approaches based on imputation or other strategies for handling missing data. We further show that our approach can accurately impute missing data after genome segmentation, reversing the typical order of imputation/genome segmentation pipelines. Finally, we present a new 2D genome segmentation analysis of 127 human cell types studied by the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium. By using an expanded set of chromatin marks that have been profiled in subsets of these cell types, our new segmentation results capture a more complex picture of combinatorial regulatory patterns that appear on the human genome.</p>}},

We used massively parallel reporter assays to perform functional comparisons of two leading enhancer models and find that gene-distal transcription start sites (TSSs) are robust predictors of enhancer activity with higher resolution and specificity than histone modifications. We show that active enhancer units are precisely delineated by active TSSs, validate that these boundaries are sufficient to capture enhancer function, and confirm that core promoter sequences are required for this activity. Finally, we assay pairs of adjacent units and find that their cumulative activity is best predicted by the strongest unit within the pair. Synthetic fusions of enhancer units demonstrate that adjacency imposes winner-takes-all logic, revealing a simple design for a maximum-activity filter of enhancer unit outputs. Together, our results define fundamental enhancer units and a principle of non-cooperativity between adjacent units.</p>}},

The Drosophila yellow gene, which is required for pigmentation, has emerged as a model system for understanding how cis-regulatory sequences evolve, providing some of the most detailed insights available into how activities of orthologous enhancers have diverged between species. Here, we examine the evolution of yellow cis-regulatory sequences on a broader scale by comparing the distribution and function of yellow enhancer activities throughout the 5' intergenic and intronic sequences of Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, and Drosophila willistoni. We find that cis-regulatory sequences driving expression in a particular tissue are more complex than previously described, with many redundant and cryptic enhancer activities. Interestingly, cryptic enhancer activities of sequences from one species often drove patterns of expression observed in other species, suggesting that the frequent evolutionary changes in yellow expression observed among Drosophila species may be facilitated by gaining and losing repression of pre-existing cis-regulatory sequences.}},

Here, we investigate contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory changes to variable intra- and interspecific gene expression using four strains of Drosophila melanogaster, three strains of D. simulans and a total of 78 genes. We show that cis-regulatory changes account for a greater proportion of the expression differences observed between rather than within species.

We developed an efficient method for calculating the expected distribution of genetic variation, given a demographic model including such events as population size changes, population splits and joins, and migration. We applied our approach to publicly available human sequencing data, searching for models that best reproduce the observed patterns. Our joint analysis of data from African, European, and Asian populations yielded new dates for when these populations diverged. In particular, we found that African and Eurasian populations diverged around 100,000 years ago. This is earlier than other genetic studies suggest, because our model includes the effects of migration, which we found to be important for reproducing observed patterns of variation in the data. We also analyzed data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations to model the peopling of the Americas. Here, we find no evidence for recurrent migration after East Asian and Native American populations diverged. Our methods are not limited to studying humans, and we hope that future sequencing projects will offer more insights into the history of both our own species and others.}},

Our method, which we call BreakCA for Breaks in Chromatin Accessible regions, allows non-coding indels to be discovered in the absence of whole genome sequencing data, out-performs popular variant callers such as the GATK-HaplotypeCaller and VarScan2, and detects known oncogenic regulatory mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. We apply BreakCA to identify indels in H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks in 23 neuroblastoma cell lines and, after removing common germline variants, we identify 23 rare germline or somatic indels that occur in multiple neuroblastoma cell lines. Among them, 4 indels are candidate oncogenic drivers that are present in 4 or 5 cell lines, absent from the genome aggregation database of over 15,000 whole genome sequences, and within the promoters or first introns of known genes (PHF21A, ADAMTS19, GPR85 and RALGDS).

By examining transcriptional activation of a reporter by the endogenous even-skipped enhancers, which are located 150 kb away, we identify three distinct topological conformation states and measure their transition kinetics. We show that sustained proximity of the enhancer to its target is required for activation. Transcription in turn affects the three-dimensional topology as it enhances the temporal stability of the proximal conformation and is associated with further spatial compaction. Furthermore, the facilitated long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the locus, causing corresponding developmental defects.

Here, we analyze a simple model of genome evolution in a constant environment in which natural selection drives the population toward a dynamic steady state where beneficial and deleterious substitutions balance. The distribution of fitness effects at this steady state is stable under further evolution and provides a natural null expectation for the DFE in a population that has evolved in a constant environment for a long time. We calculate how the shape of the evolutionarily stable DFE depends on the underlying population genetic parameters. We show that, in the absence of epistasis, the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations of a given fitness effect obeys a simple relationship independent of population genetic details.

Despite the large number of studies aiming to detect and contextualize such gene sets, there is virtually no software available to perform this task in a general, automatic, large-scale and reliable manner. This certainly occurs due to the computational challenges involved in this task, such as the appropriate modeling of data under analysis, the computation time to perform several of the required steps when dealing with genome-scale data and the highly error-prone nature of the sequence and alignment data structures needed for genome-wide positive selection detection. We present POTION, an open source, modular and end-to-end software for genome-scale detection of positive Darwinian selection in groups of homologous coding sequences. Our software represents a key step towards genome-scale, automated detection of positive selection, from predicted coding sequences and their homology relationships to high-quality groups of positively selected genes. POTION reduces false positives through several sophisticated sequence and group filters based on numeric, phylogenetic, quality and conservation criteria to remove spurious data and through multiple hypothesis corrections, and considerably reduces computation time thanks to a parallelized design. Our software achieved a high classification performance when used to evaluate a curated dataset of Trypanosoma brucei paralogs previously surveyed for positive selection. When used to analyze predicted groups of homologous genes of 19 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a case study we demonstrated the filters implemented in POTION to remove sources of errors that commonly inflate errors in positive selection detection. A thorough literature review found no other software similar to POTION in terms of customization, scale and automation. To the best of our knowledge, POTION is the first tool to allow users to construct and check hypotheses regarding the occurrence of site-based evidence of positive selection in non-curated, genome-scale data within a feasible time frame and with no human intervention after initial configuration.

Notably, mNET-seq patterns specific for different Pol II CTD phosphorylation states reveal weak co-transcriptional splicing and poly(A) signal-independent Pol II termination of lincRNAs as compared to pre-mRNAs. In addition, lincRNAs are mostly restricted to chromatin, since they are rapidly degraded by the RNA exosome. We also show that a lincRNA-specific co-transcriptional RNA cleavage mechanism acts to induce premature termination. In effect, functional lincRNAs must escape from this targeted nuclear surveillance process.}},

Most SV detection algorithms use only one of the possible signals and ignore reads with multiple alignments. This results in reduced sensitivity to detect SVs, especially in repetitive regions. We introduce GASVPro, an algorithm combining both paired read and read depth signals into a probabilistic model which can analyze multiple alignments of reads. GASVPro outperforms existing methods with a 50-90\% improvement in specificity on deletions and a 50\% improvement on inversions.}},

In cancer, gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 protein (EZH2) lead to a genome-wide increase in histone-3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) associated with transcriptional repression. However, the effects of these epigenetic changes on the structure and function of chromatin domains have not been explored. Here, we found a functional interplay between TADs and epigenetic and transcriptional changes mediated by mutated EZH2. Altered EZH2 (p.Tyr646* (EZH2Y646X)) led to silencing of entire domains, synergistically inactivating multiple tumor suppressors. Intra-TAD gene silencing was coupled with changes of interactions between gene promoter regions. Notably, gene expression and chromatin interactions were restored by pharmacological inhibition of EZH2Y646X. Our results indicate that EZH2Y646X alters the topology and function of chromatin domains to promote synergistic oncogenic programs. Oncogenic gain-of-function EZH2 mutations alter gene–promoter interactions and lead to silencing 1,034 of genes within topologically associating domains, thus resulting in inactivation of multiple tumor-suppressor genes.}},

We identified previously unannotated and often tissue- or cell-line-specific transcribed fragments (RACEfrags), both 5′ distal to the annotated 5′ terminus and internal to the annotated gene bounds for the vast majority (81.5\%) of the tested genes. Half of the distal RACEfrags span large segments of genomic sequences away from the main portion of the coding transcript and often overlap with the upstream-annotated gene(s). Notably, at least 20\% of the resultant novel transcripts have changes in their open reading frames (ORFs), most of them fusing ORFs of adjacent transcripts. A significant fraction of distal RACEfrags show expression levels comparable to those of known exons of the same locus, suggesting that they are not part of very minority splice forms. These results have significant implications concerning (1) our current understanding of the architecture of protein-coding genes; (2) our views on locations of regulatory regions in the genome; and (3) the interpretation of sequence polymorphisms mapping to regions hitherto considered to be “noncoding,” ultimately relating to the identification of disease-related sequence alterations.}},

We present ADAPT-CAGE, a Machine Learning framework which is trained to distinguish between CAGE signal derived from TSSs and transcriptional noise. ADAPT-CAGE provides annotation-agnostic, highly accurate and single-nucleotide resolution experimentally derived TSSs on a genome-wide scale. It has been specifically designed aiming for flexibility and ease-of-use by only requiring aligned CAGE data and the underlying genomic sequence. When compared to existing algorithms, ADAPT-CAGE exhibits improved performance on every benchmark that we designed based on both annotation- and experimentally-driven strategies. This performance boost brings ADAPT-CAGE in the spotlight as a computational framework that is able to assist in the refinement of gene regulatory networks, the incorporation of accurate information of gene expression regulators and alternative promoter usage in both physiological and pathological conditions.}},

We designed a widely applicable method, dubbed barcorded synthetic tandem repeat promoter screening (BC-STAR-PROM), to identify signal-activated TFs without any a priori knowledge about their properties. The BC-STAR-PROM library consists of ∼3000 luciferase expression vectors, each harboring a promoter (composed of six tandem repeats of synthetic random DNA) and an associated barcode of 20 base pairs (bp) within the 3' untranslated mRNA region. Together, the promoter sequences encompass >400,000 bp of random DNA, a sequence complexity sufficient to capture most TFs. Cells transfected with the library are exposed to a signal, and the mRNAs that it encodes are counted by next-generation sequencing of the barcodes. This allows the simultaneous activity tracking of each of the ∼3000 synthetic promoters in a single experiment. Here we establish proof of concept for BC-STAR-PROM by applying it to the identification of TFs induced by drugs affecting actin and tubulin cytoskeleton dynamics. BC-STAR-PROM revealed that serum response factor (SRF) is the only immediate early TF induced by both actin polymerization and microtubule depolymerization. Such changes in cytoskeleton dynamics are known to occur during the cell division cycle, and real-time bioluminescence microscopy indeed revealed cell-autonomous SRF-myocardin-related TF (MRTF) activity bouts in proliferating cells.}},

Here, we address both issues by performing RNA sequencing on single cell types (harvested via patch pipets) within the MB.

To address this, here we define cis regulatory elements in C. elegans, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens and investigate the determinants of their transcription directionality. In all three species, we find that divergent transcription is initiated from two separate core promoter sequences and promoter regions display competition between histone modifications on the + 1 and −1 nucleosomes. In contrast, promoter directionality, sequence composition surrounding promoters, and positional enrichment of chromatin states, are different across species. Integrative models of H3K4me3 levels and core promoter sequence are highly predictive of promoter and enhancer directionality and support two directional classes, skewed and balanced. The relative importance of features to these models are clearly distinct for promoters and enhancers. Differences in regulatory architecture within and between metazoans are therefore abundant, arguing against a unified eukaryotic model. Divergent transcription from promoters and enhancers occurs in many species, but it is unclear if it is a general feature of all eukaryotic cis regulatory elements.

Kharchenko et al. present a genome-wide chromatin landscape of the fruitfly, based on 18 histone modifications. They describe nine prevalent chromatin states. Integrating these analyses with other data types reveals individual characteristics of different genomic elements. Graveley et al. have used RNA-Seq, tiling microarrays and cDNA sequencing to explore the transcriptome in 30 distinct developmental stages of the fruitfly. Among the results are scores of new genes, coding and non-coding transcripts, as well as splicing and editing events. Finally, Nègre et al. have produced a map of the regulatory part of the fruitfly genome, defining a vast array of putative regulatory elements, such as enhancers, promoters, insulators and silencers. As part of the modENCODE initiative, which aims to characterize functional DNA elements in D. melanogaster and C. elegans, this study created a map of the regulatory part of the fruitfly genome. On the basis of the developmental dynamics of chromatin modifications, polymerase and transcription factor occupancy this work defines a vast array of putative regulatory elements, such as enhancers, promoters, insulators and silencers. This resource represents the first attempt at a comprehensive annotation of cis-regulatory elements in a metazoan genome. Systematic annotation of gene regulatory elements is a major challenge in genome science. Direct mapping of chromatin modification marks and transcriptional factor binding sites genome-wide1,2 has successfully identified specific subtypes of regulatory elements3. In Drosophila several pioneering studies have provided genome-wide identification of Polycomb response elements4, chromatin states5, transcription factor binding sites6,7,8,9, RNA polymerase II regulation8 and insulator elements10; however, comprehensive annotation of the regulatory genome remains a significant challenge. Here we describe results from the modENCODE cis-regulatory annotation project. We produced a map of the Drosophila melanogaster regulatory genome on the basis of more than 300 chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets for eight chromatin features, five histone deacetylases and thirty-eight site-specific transcription factors at different stages of development. Using these data we inferred more than 20,000 candidate regulatory elements and validated a subset of predictions for promoters, enhancers and insulators in vivo. We identified also nearly 2,000 genomic regions of dense transcription factor binding associated with chromatin activity and accessibility. We discovered hundreds of new transcription factor co-binding relationships and defined a transcription factor network with over 800 potential regulatory relationships.}},

This reaction was made cap-specific by removing 5'-phosphates of non-capped RNAs with alkaline phosphatase prior to TAP treatment. Unlike the conventional methods that label the 5' end of cDNAs, this method specifically labels the capped end of the mRNAs with a synthetic r-oligo prior to first-strand cDNA synthesis.

The key points are the following: (1) The transition from the looped domains and subdomains of interphase chromatin to the 30-nm fiber loops of early prophase chromosomes goes through their unfolding into an extended chromatin structure (probably a 10-nm "beads-on-a-string" structure); (2) the architectural proteins of interphase chromatin, such as CTCF and cohesin subunits, are retained in mitosis and are part of the discontinuous protein scaffold of mitotic chromosomes; and (3) the conservation of the link between architectural proteins and their binding sites on DNA through the cell cycle explains the reversibility of the interphase to mitosis process and the "mitotic memory" of interphase architecture.}},

Hundreds of aberrant pre-mRNA splicing events are reproducibly associated with Alzheimer’s disease. We also generate a catalog of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) effects: splicing of 3,006 genes is influenced by genetic variation. We report that altered splicing is the mechanism for the effects of the PICALM, CLU and PTK2B susceptibility alleles. Furthermore, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study and identified 21 genes with significant associations with Alzheimer’s disease, many of which are found in known loci, whereas 8 are in novel loci. These results highlight the convergence of old and new genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease in autophagy–lysosomal-related pathways. Overall, this study of the transcriptome of the aging brain provides evidence that dysregulation of mRNA splicing is a feature of Alzheimer’s disease and is, in some cases, genetically driven.}},

Indeed, documented evidence of gain of an intron has only been suggested by phylogenetic analyses. We report the use of a strategy that detects selected intron gain and loss events. We have experimentally verified, to our knowledge, the first demonstrations of intron transposition in any organism. From our screen, we detected two separate intron gain events characterized by the perfect transposition of a reporter intron into the yeast genes RPL8B and ADH2, respectively. We show that the newly acquired introns are able to be removed from their respective pre-mRNAs by the spliceosome. Additionally, the novel allele, RPL8Bint, is functional when overexpressed within the genome in a strain lacking the Rpl8 paralogue RPL8A, demonstrating that the gene targeted for intronogenesis is functional.}},

In order to identify novel epigenomic traits of regulatory elements, we constructed a benchmark set of validated enhancers by performing 140 enhancer assays in human T cells. We tested 40 chromatin signatures on this unbiased enhancer set and identified H2BK20ac, a little-studied histone modification, as the most predictive mark of active enhancers. Notably, we detected a novel class of functionally distinct enhancers enriched in H2BK20ac but lacking H3K27ac, which was present in all examined cell lines and also embryonic forebrain tissue. H2BK20ac was also unique in highlighting cell-type-specific promoters. In contrast, other acetylation marks were present at all active promoters, regardless of cell-type specificity. In stimulated microglial cells, H2BK20ac was more correlated with cell-state-specific expression changes than H3K27ac, with TGF-beta signaling decoupling the two acetylation marks at a subset of regulatory elements. In summary, our study reveals a previously unknown connection between histone acetylation and cell-type-specific gene regulation and indicates that H2BK20ac profiling can be used to uncover new dimensions of gene regulation.}},

Findings obtained over the last decade that not only promoters but also enhancers are characterized by bidirectional, divergent transcription have challenged the traditional notion that promoters and enhancers represent distinct classes of regulatory elements. Over half of human promoters are associated with CpG islands (CGIs), relatively CpG-rich stretches of generally several hundred nucleotides that are often associated with housekeeping genes. Only about 6\% of transcribed enhancers defined by CAGE-tag analysis are associated with CGIs. Here, we present an analysis of enhancer and promoter characteristics and relate them to the presence or absence of CGIs. We show that transcribed enhancers share a number of CGI-dependent characteristics with promoters, including statistically significant local overrepresentation of core promoter elements. CGI-associated enhancers are longer, display higher directionality of transcription, greater expression, a lesser degree of tissue specificity, and a higher frequency of transcription-factor binding events than non-CGI-associated enhancers. Genes putatively regulated by CGI-associated enhancers are enriched for transcription regulator activity. Our findings show that CGI-associated transcribed enhancers display a series of characteristics related to sequence, expression and function that distinguish them from enhancers not associated with CGIs.}},

Zea mays (maize) RNA polymerase D1 (RPD1), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), is required for normal plant development, paramutation, transcriptional repression of certain transposable elements (TEs), and transcriptional regulation of specific alleles. Here, we define the nascent transcriptomes of rpd1 mutant and wild-type (WT) seedlings using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) to identify the broader targets of RPD1-based regulation. Comparisons of WT and rpd1 mutant GRO-seq profiles indicate that Pol IV globally affects transcription at both transcriptional start sites and immediately downstream of polyadenylation addition sites. We found no evidence of divergent transcription from gene promoters as seen in mammalian GRO-seq profiles. Statistical comparisons identify genes and TEs whose transcription is affected by RPD1. Most examples of significant increases in genic antisense transcription appear to be initiated by 3'-proximal long terminal repeat retrotransposons.

Whole genome resequencing of 14 evolved strains and the parental strain revealed a total of 153 mutations in the evolved strains, including single nucleotide variants, small INDELs, and segmental duplication/deletion events. Some mutations persisted from an intermediate temperature to 42 °C, so they might be Htg+ mutations. Functional categorization of mutations revealed enrichment of exonic mutations in the SWI/SNF complex and F-type ATPase, pointing to their involvement in high-temperature tolerance. In addition, multiple mutations were found in a general stress-associated signal transduction network consisting of Hog1 mediated pathway, RAS-cAMP pathway, and Rho1-Pkc1 mediated cell wall integrity pathway, implying that cells can achieve Htg+ partly through modifying existing stress regulatory mechanisms. Using pooled segregant analysis of five Htg+ phenotype-orientated pools, we inferred causative mutations for growth at 42 °C and identified those mutations with stronger impacts on the phenotype. Finally, we experimentally validated a number of the candidate Htg+ mutations. This study increased our understanding of the genetic basis of yeast tolerance to high temperature.}},

  doi = {10.1186/s12864-016-2940-7}, 
  abstract = {{BACKGROUND:ChIP-seq provides a wealth of information on the approximate location of DNA-binding proteins genome-wide. It is known that the targeted motifs in most cases can be found at the peak centers. A high resolution mapping of ChIP-seq peaks could in principle allow the fine mapping of the protein constituents within protein complexes, but the current ChIP-seq analysis pipelines do not target the basepair resolution strand specific mapping of peak summits.

RESULTS:The approach proposed here is based on i) locating regions that are bound by a sufficient number of proteins constituting a complex; ii) determining the position of the underlying motif using either a direct or a de novo motif search approach; and iii) determining the exact location of the peak summits with respect to the binding motif in a strand specific manner. We applied this method for analyzing the CTCF/cohesin complex, which holds together DNA loops. The relative positions of the constituents of the complex were determined with one-basepair estimated accuracy. Mapping the positions on a 3D model of DNA made it possible to deduce the approximate local topology of the complex that allowed us to predict how the CTCF/cohesin complex locks the DNA loops. As the positioning of the proteins was not compatible with previous models of loop closure, we proposed a plausible "double embrace" model in which the DNA loop is held together by two adjacent cohesin rings in such a way that the ring anchored by CTCF to one DNA duplex encircles the other DNA double helix and vice versa.

CONCLUSIONS:A motif-centered, strand specific analysis of ChIP-seq data improves the accuracy of determining peak positions. If a genome contains a large number of binding sites for a given protein complex, such as transcription factor heterodimers or transcription factor/cofactor complexes, the relative position of the constituent proteins on the DNA can be established with an accuracy that allow one to deduce the local topology of the protein complex. The proposed high resolution mapping approach of ChIP-seq data is applicable for detecting the contact topology of DNA-binding protein complexes.}},

  doi = {10.1101/603290}, 
  abstract = {{<p>Iron (Fe) is a key cofactor in many cellular redox processes, including respiration and photosynthesis. Plant Fe deficiency (-Fe) activates a complex regulatory network which coordinates root Fe uptake and distribution to sink tissues, while avoiding over-accumulation of Fe and other metals to toxic levels. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), FIT (FER-LIKE FE DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR), a bHLH transcription factor (TF), is required for up-regulation of root Fe acquisition genes. However, other root and shoot -Fe-induced genes involved in Fe allocation and signaling are FIT-independent. The cis-regulatory code, i.e. the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and their combinations that regulate plant -Fe-responses, remains largely elusive. Using Arabidopsis genome and transcriptome data, we identified over 100 putative CREs (pCREs) that were predictive of -Fe-induced up-regulation of genes in root tissue. We used large-scale in vitro TF binding data, association with FIT-dependent or FIT-independent co-expression clusters, positional bias, and evolutionary conservation to assess pCRE properties and possible functions.

Inversions can capture multiple locally adaptive functional variants in a linked block by repressing recombination. However, this property makes it difficult to identify the genetic mechanisms that underlie an inversion's role in adaption. In this study, we explore how large-scale transcriptomic data can be used to dissect the functional importance of chromosomal inversions. Specifically, we study a 13 Mb inversion locus found almost exclusively in highland populations of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) known as Inv4m. Inv4m is known to have introgressed into domesticated maize from a wild relative also present in the highlands of Mexico and is thought to be important for the adaptation of certain maize landraces to cultivation in highland environments. First, using a large publicly available association mapping panel, we confirmed that Inv4m is associated with locally adaptive agronomic phenotypes, but only in highland fields. Second, we created two Near Isogenic Line populations segregating for alternative alleles of Inv4m, and measured gene expression variation association with Inv4m across 9 tissues in two experimental conditions. With these data, we quantified both the global transcriptomic effects of the highland Inv4m allele, and the local cis-regulatory variation present within the locus. We found diverse physiological effects of Inv4m, and speculate that the genetic basis of its effects on adaptive traits is distributed across many separate functional variants.}},

Currently, data from genome and exome sequencing or proteomic studies are searched against reference genome annotations. This provides the foundation for research and clinical screening for genetic causes of pathologies. However, current genome annotations substantially underestimate the proteomic information encoded within a gene. Numerous studies have now demonstrated the expression and function of alternative (mainly small, sometimes overlapping) ORFs within mature gene transcripts. This has important consequences for the correlation of phenotypes and genotypes. Most alternative ORFs are not yet annotated because of a lack of evidence, and this absence from databases precludes their detection by standard proteomic methods, such as mass spectrometry. Here, we demonstrate how current approaches tend to overlook alternative ORFs, hindering the discovery of new genetic drivers and fundamental research. We discuss available tools and techniques to improve identification of proteins from alternative ORFs and finally suggest a novel annotation system to permit a more complete representation of the transcriptomic and proteomic information contained within a gene. Given the crucial challenge of distinguishing functional ORFs from random ones, the suggested pipeline emphasizes both experimental data and conservation signatures. The addition of alternative ORFs in databases will render identification less serendipitous and advance the pace of research and genomic knowledge. This review highlights the urgent medical and research need to incorporate alternative ORFs in current genome annotations and thus permit their inclusion in hypotheses and models, which relate phenotypes and genotypes.}},

We address this question using high-throughput measurements in rapidly growing cells from diverse organisms to find that about half of the rate combinations do not exist: genes that combine high transcription with low translation are strongly depleted. This depletion is due to a trade-off between precision and economy: high transcription decreases stochastic fluctuations but increases transcription costs. Our theory quantitatively explains which rate combinations are missing, and predicts the curvature of the fitness function for each gene. It may guide the design of gene circuits with desired expression levels and noise. The same protein abundance can be achieved by many combinations of transcription, translation and degradation rates. Here, the authors find that genes combining high transcription with low translation rate are rare due to a trade-off between the cost of transcription and expression noise.}},

We used this method to investigate thousands of native promoters and preinitiation complex (PIC) binding regions followed by in-depth characterization of the sequence motifs underlying promoter activity, including core promoter elements and TF binding sites. We find that core promoters drive transcription mostly unidirectionally and that sequences originating from promoters exhibit stronger activity than those originating from enhancers. By testing multiple synthetic configurations of core promoter elements, we dissect the motifs that positively and negatively regulate transcription as well as the effect of their combinations and distances, including a 10-bp periodicity in the optimal distance between the TATA and the initiator. By comprehensively screening 133 TF binding sites, we find that in contrast to core promoters, TF binding sites maintain similar activity levels in both orientations, supporting a model by which divergent transcription is driven by two distinct unidirectional core promoters sharing bidirectional TF binding sites. Finally, we find a striking agreement between the effect of binding site multiplicity of individual TFs in our assay and their tendency to appear in homotypic clusters throughout the genome. Overall, our study systematically assays the elements that drive expression in core and proximal promoter regions and sheds light on organization principles of regulatory regions in the human genome.}},

Our results show that although most TE classes are primarily associated with reduced gene expression, Alu elements are associated with up regulated gene expression. Furthermore, Alu elements had the highest probability of any TE class of contributing to regulatory regions of any type defined by chromatin state. This suggests a general model where clade specific SINEs may contribute more to gene regulation than ancient/ancestral TEs. Finally, non-coding regions were found to have a high probability of TE content within regulatory sequences, most notably in repressors.

  abstract = {{Genome-wide epigenetic marks regulate gene expression, but the amount and function of variability in these marks are poorly understood. Working with human-derived samples, Onuchic et al. examined disease-associated genetic variation and sequence-dependent allele-specific methylation at gene regulatory loci. Regulatory sequences within individual chromosomal DNA molecules showed full or no methylation at specific sites corresponding to “on” and “off” switches. Interestingly, methylation did not occur on each DNA molecule, resulting in a variable fraction of methylated chromosomes. This stochastic type of gene regulation was more common for rare genetic variants, which may suggest a role in human disease. Science , this issue p. [eaar3146][1] \#\#\# INTRODUCTION A majority of imbalances in DNA methylation between homologous chromosomes in humans are sequence-dependent; the DNA sequence differences between the two chromosomes cause differences in the methylation state of neighboring cytosines on the same chromosome. The analyses of this sequence-dependent allele-specific methylation (SD-ASM) traditionally involved measurement of average methylation levels across many cells. Detailed understanding of SD-ASM at the single-cell and single-chromosome levels is lacking. This gap in understanding may hide the connection between SD-ASM, ubiquitous stochastic cell-to-cell and chromosome-to-chromosome variation in DNA methylation, and the puzzling and evolutionarily conserved patterns of intermediate methylation at gene regulatory loci. \#\#\# RATIONALE Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) provides the ultimate single-chromosome level of resolution and comprehensive whole-genome coverage required to explore SD-ASM. However, the exploration of the link between SD-ASM, stochastic variation in DNA methylation, and gene regulation requires deep coverage by WGBS across tissues and individuals and the context of other epigenomic marks and gene transcription. \#\#\# RESULTS We constructed maps of allelic imbalances in DNA methylation, histone marks, and gene transcription in 71 epigenomes from 36 distinct cell and tissue types from 13 donors. Deep (1691-fold) combined WGBS read coverage across 49 methylomes revealed CpG methylation imbalances exceeding 30\% differences at 5\% of the loci, which is more conservative than previous estimates in the 8 to 10\% range; a similar value (8\%) is observed in our dataset when we lowered our threshold for detecting allelic imbalance to 20\% methylation difference between the two alleles. Extensive sequence-dependent CpG methylation imbalances were observed at thousands of heterozygous regulatory loci. Stochastic switching, defined as random transitions between fully methylated and unmethylated states of DNA, occurred at thousands of regulatory loci bound by transcription factors (TFs). Our results explain the conservation of intermediate methylation states at regulatory loci by showing that the intermediate methylation reflects the relative frequencies of fully methylated and fully unmethylated epialleles. SD-ASM is explainable by different relative frequencies of methylated and unmethylated epialleles for the two alleles. The differences in epiallele frequency spectra of the alleles at thousands of TF-bound regulatory loci correlated with the differences in alleles’ affinities for TF binding, which suggests a mechanistic explanation for SD-ASM. We observed an excess of rare variants among those showing SD-ASM, which suggests that an average human genome harbors at least \textbackslashtextasciitilde200 detrimental rare variants that also show SD-ASM. The methylome’s sensitivity to genetic variation is unevenly distributed across the genome, which is consistent with buffering of housekeeping genes against the effects of random mutations. By contrast, less essential genes with tissue-specific expression patterns show sensitivity, thus providing opportunity for evolutionary innovation through changes in gene regulation. \#\#\# CONCLUSION Analysis of allelic epigenome maps provides a unifying model that links sequence-dependent allelic imbalances of the epigenome, stochastic switching at gene regulatory loci, selective buffering of the regulatory circuitry against the effects of random mutations, and disease-associated genetic variation. ![Figure][2]</img> SD-ASM is explainable by different frequencies of epialleles. Genetic variants affect the methylation state of neighboring cytosines on the same chromosome. Every WGBS read provides a readout of both a genetic variant (G or T) at a heterozygous locus and the methylation state of neighboring cytosines (“epiallele”). Epiallele frequencies correlate with the affinity of TF binding at regulatory sites. To assess the impact of genetic variation in regulatory loci on human health, we constructed a high-resolution map of allelic imbalances in DNA methylation, histone marks, and gene transcription in 71 epigenomes from 36 distinct cell and tissue types from 13 donors. Deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 49 methylomes revealed sequence-dependent CpG methylation imbalances at thousands of heterozygous regulatory loci. Such loci are enriched for stochastic switching, which is defined as random transitions between fully methylated and unmethylated states of DNA. The methylation imbalances at thousands of loci are explainable by different relative frequencies of the methylated and unmethylated states for the two alleles. Further analyses provided a unifying model that links sequence-dependent allelic imbalances of the epigenome, stochastic switching at gene regulatory loci, and disease-associated genetic variation.

Here we report that the l-galactose pathway of ascorbate biosynthesis described in higher plants is conserved in green algae. The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome encodes all the enzymes required for vitamin C biosynthesis via the l-galactose pathway. We have characterized recombinant C. reinhardtii VTC2 as an active GDP-l-galactose phosphorylase. C. reinhardtii cells exposed to oxidative stress show increased VTC2 mRNA and l-ascorbate levels. Genes encoding enzymatic components of the ascorbate-glutathione system (e.g. ascorbate peroxidase, manganese superoxide dismutase, and dehydroascorbate reductase) are also up-regulated in response to increased oxidative stress. These results indicate that C. reinhardtii VTC2, like its plant homologs, is a highly regulated enzyme in ascorbate biosynthesis in green algae and that, together with the ascorbate recycling system, the l-galactose pathway represents the major route for providing protective levels of ascorbate in oxidatively stressed algal cells.}},

It is fairly easy to understand how selection might have shaped these horns, but understanding how development shaped them from a hornless ancestor is a much more complex proposition. Hu et al. show that these horns are generated from wing homologs and argue that many other insect traits may have followed similar transcriptional paths (see the Perspective by Nijhout). Science , this issue p. [1004][1]; see also p. [946][2] Understanding how novel complex traits originate is a foundational challenge in evolutionary biology. We investigated the origin of prothoracic horns in scarabaeine beetles, one of the most pronounced examples of secondary sexual traits in the animal kingdom. We show that prothoracic horns derive from bilateral source tissues; that diverse wing genes are functionally required for instructing this process; and that, in the absence of Hox input, prothoracic horn primordia transform to contribute to ectopic wings. Once induced, however, the transcriptional profile of prothoracic horns diverges markedly from that of wings and other wing serial homologs. Our results substantiate the serial homology between prothoracic horns and insects wings and suggest that other insect innovations may derive similarly from wing serial homologs and the concomitant establishment of structure-specific transcriptional landscapes.

We combined experimental evolution with time-shift experiments, in which a focal host or pathogen is tested against a coevolved antagonist from the past, present, or future, followed by genomic analysis. We show that (i) coevolution occurs rapidly within few generations, (ii) temporal coadaptation at the phenotypic level is found in parallel across replicate populations, consistent with antagonistic frequency-dependent selection, (iii) genomic changes in the pathogen match the phenotypic pattern and include copy number variations of a toxin-encoding plasmid, and (iv) host genomic changes do not match the phenotypic pattern and likely involve selective responses at more than one locus. By exploring the dynamics of coevolution at the phenotypic and genomic level for both host and pathogen simultaneously, our findings demonstrate a more complex model of the Red Queen, consisting of distinct selective processes acting on the two antagonists during rapid and reciprocal coadaptation.}},

  abstract = {{In Drosophila, each external sensory organ originates from the division of a unique precursor cell (the sensory organ precursor cell or SOP). Each SOP is specified from a cluster of equivalent cells, called a proneural cluster, all of them competent to become SOP. Although, it is well known how SOP cells are selected from proneural clusters, little is known about the downstream genes that are regulated during SOP fate specification. In order to better understand the mechanism involved in the specification of these precursor cells, we combined laser microdissection, toisolate SOP cells, with transcriptome analysis, to study their RNA profile. Using this procedure, we found that genes that exhibit a 2-fold or greater expression in SOPs versus epithelial cells were mainly associated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms related with cell fate determination and sensory organ specification. Furthermore, we found that several genes such as pebbled/hindsight, scabrous, miranda, senseless, or cut, known to be expressed in SOP cells by independent procedures, are particularly detected in laser microdissected SOP cells rather than in epithelial cells. These results confirm the feasibility and the specificity of our laser microdissection based procedure. We anticipate that this analysis will give new insight into the selection and specification of neural precursor cells.}},

To identify TSSs in Drosophila melanogaster, we applied a hierarchical clustering strategy on available 5' expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and identified a high quality set of 5,665 TSSs for approximately 4,000 genes. We distinguished two initiation patterns: 'peaked' TSSs, and 'broad' TSS cluster groups. Peaked promoters were found to contain location-specific sequence elements; conversely, broad promoters were associated with non-location-specific elements. In alignments across other Drosophila genomes, conservation levels of sequence elements exceeded 90\% within the melanogaster subgroup, but dropped considerably for distal species. Elements in broad promoters had lower levels of conservation than those in peaked promoters. When characterizing the distributions of ESTs, 64\% of TSSs showed distinct associations to one out of eight different spatiotemporal conditions. Available whole-genome tiling array time series data revealed different temporal patterns of embryonic activity across the majority of genes with distinct alternative promoters. Many genes with maternally inherited transcripts were found to have alternative promoters utilized later in development. Core promoters of maternally inherited transcripts showed differences in motif composition compared to zygotically active promoters. Our study provides a comprehensive map of Drosophila TSSs and the conditions under which they are utilized. Distinct differences in motif associations with initiation pattern and spatiotemporal utilization illustrate the complex regulatory code of transcription initiation.}},

We demonstrate that tissue transglutaminase 2 can serotonylate histone H3 tri-methylated lysine 4 (H3K4me3)-marked nucleosomes, resulting in the presence of combinatorial H3K4me3Q5ser in vivo. H3K4me3Q5ser displays a ubiquitous pattern of tissue expression in mammals, with enrichment observed in brain and gut, two organ systems responsible for the bulk of 5-HT production. Genome-wide analyses of human serotonergic neurons, developing mouse brain and cultured serotonergic cells indicate that H3K4me3Q5ser nucleosomes are enriched in euchromatin, are sensitive to cellular differentiation and correlate with permissive gene expression, phenomena that are linked to the potentiation of TFIID4–6 interactions with H3K4me3. Cells that ectopically express a H3 mutant that cannot be serotonylated display significantly altered expression of H3K4me3Q5ser-target loci, which leads to deficits in differentiation. Taken together, these data identify a direct role for 5-HT, independent from its contributions to neurotransmission and cellular signalling, in the mediation of permissive gene expression.}},

We observed sexually dimorphic patterns of gene expression involving as many as 60\% of autosomal genes, depending on the tissue. Interestingly, sex hormone receptors do not exhibit sexually dimorphic expression in most tissues; however, differential network targeting by hormone receptors and other transcription factors (TFs) captures their downstream sexually dimorphic gene expression. Furthermore, differential network wiring was found extensively in several tissues, particularly in brain, in which not all regions exhibit strong differential expression. This systems-based analysis provides a new perspective on the drivers of sexual dimorphism, one in which a repertoire of TFs plays important roles in sex-specific rewiring of gene regulatory networks.}},

We found that in all cases, tolerance preceded resistance. A mathematical population-genetics model showed how tolerance boosts the chances for resistance mutations to spread in the population. Thus, tolerance mutations pave the way for the rapid subsequent evolution of resistance. Preventing the evolution of tolerance may offer a new strategy for delaying the emergence of resistance.}},

Although initially considered to have limited function, an increasing number of orphan genes have been shown to provide important phenotypic innovation. How new genes acquire regulatory sequences for proper temporal and spatial expression is unknown. Orphan gene regulation may rely in part on origination in open chromatin adjacent to preexisting promoters, although this has not yet been assessed by genome-wide analysis of chromatin states. Here, we combine taxon-rich nematode phylogenies with Iso-Seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq to identify the gene structure and epigenetic signature of orphan genes in the satellite model nematode Pristionchus pacificus. Consistent with previous findings, we find young genes are shorter, contain fewer exons, and are on average less strongly expressed than older genes. However, the subset of orphan genes that are expressed exhibit distinct chromatin states from similarly expressed conserved genes. Orphan gene transcription is determined by a lack of repressive histone modifications, confirming long-held hypotheses that open chromatin is important for new gene formation. Yet orphan gene start sites more closely resemble enhancers defined by H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and ATAC-seq peaks, in contrast to conserved genes that exhibit traditional promoters defined by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. Although the majority of orphan genes are located on chromosome arms that contain high recombination rates and repressive histone marks, strongly expressed orphan genes are more randomly distributed. Our results support a model of new gene origination by rare integration into open chromatin near enhancers.}},

While the role of accessibility in shaping TF-binding landscapes is well recorded, its role in evolutionary divergence of TF binding, which in turn can alter cis-regulatory activities, is not well understood. In this work, we studied the evolution of genome-wide binding landscapes of five major transcription factors (TFs) in the core network of mesoderm specification, between D. melanogaster and D. virilis, and examined its relationship to accessibility and sequence-level changes. We generated chromatin accessibility data from three important stages of embryogenesis in both D. melanogaster and D. virilis, and recorded conservation and divergence patterns. We then used multi-variable models to correlate accessibility and sequence changes to TF binding divergence. We found that accessibility changes can in some cases, e.g., for the master regulator Twist and for earlier developmental stages, more accurately predict binding change than is possible using TF binding motif changes between orthologous enhancers. Accessibility changes also explain a significant portion of the co-divergence of TF pairs. We noted that accessibility and motif changes offer complementary views of the evolution of TF binding, and developed a combined model that captures the evolutionary data much more accurately than either view alone. Finally, we trained machine learning models to predict enhancer activity from TF binding, and used these functional models to argue that motif and accessibility-based predictors of TF binding change can substitute for experimentally measured binding change, for the purpose of predicting evolutionary changes in enhancer activity.</p>}},

We found that in actively growing cells, the per-cell rDNA and rRNA CNs scaled with cell volume (CV) to 0.44 and 0.58 powers, respectively. The modeled rDNA and rRNA concentrations thus appear to be much higher in smaller than in larger cells. The observed rRNA:rDNA ratio scaled with CV0.14. The maximum growth rate could be well predicted by a combination of per-cell ribotype CN and temperature. Our empirical data and modeling on single-cell ribotype scaling are in agreement with both the metabolic theory of ecology and the growth rate hypothesis, providing a quantitative framework for linking cellular rDNA and rRNA CNs with body size, growth (activity), and biomass stoichiometry. This study also demonstrates that the expression rate of rRNA genes is constrained by cell size, and favors biomass rather than abundance-based interpretation of quantitative ribotype data in population and community ecology of protists.}},

This effect of introns on growth is not linked to the expression of the host gene, and was reproduced even when translation of the host mRNA was blocked. Transcriptomic and genetic analyses indicate that introns promote resistance to starvation by enhancing the repression of ribosomal protein genes that are downstream of the nutrient-sensing TORC1 and PKA pathways. Our results reveal functions of introns that may help to explain their evolutionary preservation in genes, and uncover regulatory mechanisms of cell adaptations to starvation.

Here, we devised a high-throughput assay to quantify the activity of approximately 15,000 fully designed sequences that we integrated and expressed from a fixed location within the human genome. We used this method to investigate thousands of native promoters and preinitiation complex (PIC) binding regions followed by in-depth characterization of the sequence motifs underlying promoter activity, including core promoter elements and TF binding sites. We find that core promoters drive transcription mostly unidirectionally and that sequences originating from promoters exhibit stronger activity than those originating from enhancers. By testing multiple synthetic configurations of core promoter elements, we dissect the motifs that positively and negatively regulate transcription as well as the effect of their combinations and distances, including a 10-bp periodicity in the optimal distance between the TATA and the initiator. By comprehensively screening 133 TF binding sites, we find that in contrast to core promoters, TF binding sites maintain similar activity levels in both orientations, supporting a model by which divergent transcription is driven by two distinct unidirectional core promoters sharing bidirectional TF binding sites. Finally, we find a striking agreement between the effect of binding site multiplicity of individual TFs in our assay and their tendency to appear in homotypic clusters throughout the genome. Overall, our study systematically assays the elements that drive expression in core and proximal promoter regions and sheds light on organization principles of regulatory regions in the human genome.}},

To this end, we profiled TSSs activity genome-wide in S. pombe cultures exposed to heat shock, nitrogen starvation, peroxide and two commonly applied media, YES and EMM2, using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE). We show that CAGE-based annotation of TSS is substantially more accurate than existing PomBase annotation, and that S. pombe core promoters commonly initiate transcription bidirectionally at the edges of nucleosomes, but do not show sharp and dispersed TSS distributions as higher eukaryotes. Our data recapitulate known S. pombe stress expression response patterns, but also identify stress-responsible alternative TSSs. Importantly, growth media change induces changes of similar magnitude as some stressors. Integration of genetic variation data shows a link between nucleosome occupancy and genetic variation, and that the proximal promoter region is genetically diverse between S. pombe strains compared to the TATA and TSS regions.

The potential contributions of physicochemical properties of enhancer assembly in signaling events remain poorly understood. Here we report that in human breast cancer cells, the acute 17β-estradiol-dependent activation of functional enhancers requires assembly of an enhancer RNA–dependent ribonucleoprotein (eRNP) complex exhibiting properties of phase-separated condensates. Unexpectedly, while acute ligand-dependent assembly of eRNPs resulted in enhancer activation sensitive to chemical disruption of phase separation, chronically activated enhancers proved resistant to such disruption, with progressive maturation of eRNPs to a more gel-like state. Acute, but not chronic, stimulation resulted in ligand-induced, condensin-dependent changes in spatial chromatin conformation based on homotypic enhancer association, resulting in cooperative enhancer-activation events. Thus, distinct physicochemical properties of eRNP condensates on enhancers serve as determinants of rapid ligand-dependent alterations in chromosomal architecture and cooperative enhancer activation. After acute agonist stimulation, phase-separated complexes form at estrogen-receptor-bound enhancer sites and coalesce into condensates with cooperative enhancer activity. Chronic stimulation causes the condensates to mature into a less dynamic, gel-like state.}},

Sequence inspection often leads to discovery of novel motifs (including transcription factor sites) with previously uncharacterized function in gene expression. Coupled with the complexity underlying tissue-specific gene expression, there are several motifs that are putatively responsible for expression in a certain cell type. This has important implications in understanding fundamental biological processes such as development and disease progression. In this work, we present an approach to the identification of motifs (not necessarily transcription factor sites) and examine its application to some questions in current bioinformatics research. These motifs are seen to discriminate tissue-specific gene promoter or regulatory regions from those that are not tissue-specific. There are two main contributions of this work. Firstly, we propose the use of directed information for such classification constrained motif discovery, and then use the selected features with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to find the tissue specificity of any sequence of interest. Such analysis yields several novel interesting motifs that merit further experimental characterization. Furthermore, this approach leads to a principled framework for the prospective examination of any chosen motif to be discriminatory motif for a group of coexpressed/coregulated genes, thereby integrating sequence and expression perspectives. We hypothesize that the discovery of these motifs would enable the large-scale investigation for the tissue-specific regulatory role of any conserved sequence element identified from genome-wide studies.}},

  abstract = {{Biomedical applications of high-throughput sequencing methods generate a vast amount of data in which numerous chromatin features are mapped along the genome. The results are frequently analysed by creating binary data sets that link the presence/absence of a given feature to specific genomic loci. However, the nucleosome occupancy or chromatin accessibility landscape is essentially continuous. It is currently a challenge in the field to cope with continuous distributions of deep sequencing chromatin readouts and to integrate the different types of discrete chromatin features to reveal linkages between them. Here we introduce the NucTools suite of Perl scripts as well as MATLAB- and R-based visualization programs for a nucleosome-centred downstream analysis of deep sequencing data. NucTools accounts for the continuous distribution of nucleosome occupancy. It allows calculations of nucleosome occupancy profiles averaged over several replicates, comparisons of nucleosome occupancy landscapes between different experimental conditions, and the estimation of the changes of integral chromatin properties such as the nucleosome repeat length. Furthermore, NucTools facilitates the annotation of nucleosome occupancy with other chromatin features like binding of transcription factors or architectural proteins, and epigenetic marks like histone modifications or DNA methylation. The applications of NucTools are demonstrated for the comparison of several datasets for nucleosome occupancy in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The typical workflows of data processing and integrative analysis with NucTools reveal information on the interplay of nucleosome positioning with other features such as for example binding of a transcription factor CTCF, regions with stable and unstable nucleosomes, and domains of large organized chromatin K9me2 modifications (LOCKs). As potential limitations and problems we discuss how inter-replicate variability of MNase-seq experiments can be addressed.}},

Here, we investigate contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory changes to variable intra- and interspecific gene expression using four strains of Drosophila melanogaster, three strains of D. simulans and a total of 78 genes. We show that cis-regulatory changes account for a greater proportion of the expression differences observed between rather than within species. These data are inconsistent with a neutral model assuming equal probabilities of fixation for cis- and trans-regulatory polymorphisms, suggesting that natural selection influences the molecular mechanisms underlying divergent gene expression.

Using embryonic gene expression across 75 Drosophila isogenic lines, we identify features predictive of expression variation, while controlling for expression level. Genes with low variation fall into two classes, indicating they employ different mechanisms to maintain a robust expression. In contrast, genes with high variation seem to lack both types of stabilizing mechanisms. Applying the framework to human tissues from GTEx revealed similar predictive features, indicating that promoter architecture is an ancient mechanism to control expression variation. Remarkably, expression variation features could also predict differential expression upon stress in both Drosophila and human. Differential gene expression signatures may therefore be partially explained by genetically encoded gene-specific features, unrelated to the studied treatment.}},

Here, we show, through extensive analysis of the methylome and transcriptome in 34 tissues, that in many such cases, transcription is initiated by a distal upstream CpG island (CGI) located several kilobases away that functions as an alternative promoter. Specifically, such genes are expressed precisely when the neighboring CGI is unmethylated but remain silenced otherwise. Based on CAGE and Pol II localization data, we found strong evidence of transcription initiation at the upstream CGI and a lack thereof at the methylated proximal promoter itself. Consistent with their alternative promoter activity, CGI-initiated transcripts are associated with signals of stable elongation and splicing that extend into the gene body, as evidenced by tissue-specific RNA-seq and other DNA-encoded splice signals. Furthermore, based on both inter- and intra-species analyses, such CGIs were found to be under greater purifying selection relative to CGIs upstream of silenced genes. Overall, our study describes a hitherto unreported conserved mechanism of transcription of genes with methylated proximal promoters in a tissue-specific fashion. Importantly, this phenomenon explains the aberrant expression patterns of some cancer driver genes, potentially due to aberrant hypomethylation of distal CGIs, despite methylation at proximal promoters.}},

The fraction of amino acid mutations that is neutral is estimated to be 0.20 from the ratio of common amino acid ( A ) to synonymous ( S ) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at frequencies of ≥ 15\%. Among the 80\% of amino acid mutations that are deleterious at least 20\% of them are only slightly deleterious and often attain frequencies of 1–10\%. We estimate that these slightly deleterious mutations comprise at least 3\% of amino acid SNPs in the average individual or at least 300 per diploid genome.

Key players in determining gene-specific regulation are transcription factors that bind sequence-specific sites on the DNA, modulating the expression of nearby genes. To understand the regulatory program of the cell, we need to identify these transcription factors, when they act, and on which genes. Transcription regulatory maps can be assembled by computational analysis of experimental data, by discovering the DNA recognition sequences (motifs) of transcription factors and their occurrences along the genome. Such an analysis usually results in a large number of overlapping motifs. To reconstruct regulatory maps, it is crucial to combine similar motifs and to relate them to transcription factors. To this end we developed an accurate fully-automated method, termed BLiC, based upon an improved similarity measure for comparing DNA motifs. By applying it to genome-wide data in yeast, we identified the DNA motifs of transcription factors and their putative target genes. Finally, we analyze motifs of transcription factor that alter their target genes under different conditions, and show how cells adjust their regulatory program in response to environmental changes.}},

Here, we provide a genome-wide analysis of the rate and spectrum of mutations obtained in two Daphnia pulex genotypes via separate mutation-accumulation (MA) experiments. Unlike most MA studies that utilize haploid, homozygous, or self-fertilizing lines, D. pulex can be propagated ameiotically while maintaining a naturally heterozygous, diploid genome, allowing the capture of the full spectrum of genomic changes that arise in a heterozygous state. While base-substitution mutation rates are similar to those in other multicellular eukaryotes (about 4 × 10(-9) per site per generation), we find that the rates of large-scale (>100 kb) de novo copy-number variants (CNVs) are significantly elevated relative to those seen in previous MA studies. The heterozygosity maintained in this experiment allowed for estimates of gene-conversion processes. While most of the conversion tract lengths we report are similar to those generated by meiotic processes, we also find larger tract lengths that are indicative of mitotic processes. Comparison of MA lines to natural isolates reveals that a majority of large-scale CNVs in natural populations are removed by purifying selection. The mutations observed here share similarities with disease-causing, complex, large-scale CNVs, thereby demonstrating that MA studies in D. pulex serve as a system for studying the processes leading to such alterations.}},

We derived synonymous gene co-expression networks from AGEMAP expression data for 16-month-old and 24-month-old mice. We identified a number of functional gene groups that change co-expression with age. Among these changing groups we found a trend towards declining correlation with age. In particular, we identified a modular (as opposed to uniform) decline in general correlation with age. We identified potential transcriptional mechanisms that may aid in modular correlation decline. We found that computationally identified targets of the NF-ΚB transcription factor decrease expression correlation with age. Finally, we found that genes that are prone to declining co-expression tend to be co-located on the chromosome. Our results conclude that there is a modular decline in co-expression with age in mice. They also indicate that factors relating to both chromosome domains and specific transcription factors may contribute to the decline.}},

  abstract = {{Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, yet their function remains largely unknown. Experimental evidence suggests that many of these elements play regulatory roles, but little is known about regulatory motifs contained within them. Here we describe a systematic approach to discover and characterize regulatory motifs within mammalian CNEs by searching for long motifs (12-22 nt) with significant enrichment in CNEs and studying their biochemical and genomic properties. Our analysis identifies 233 long motifs (LMs), matching a total of approximately 60,000 conserved instances across the human genome. These motifs include 16 previously known regulatory elements, such as the histone 3'-UTR motif and the neuron-restrictive silencer element, as well as striking examples of novel functional elements. The most highly enriched motif (LM1) corresponds to the X-box motif known from yeast and nematode. We show that it is bound by the RFX1 protein and identify thousands of conserved motif instances, suggesting a broad role for the RFX family in gene regulation. A second group of motifs (LM2*) does not match any previously known motif. We demonstrate by biochemical and computational methods that it defines a binding site for the CTCF protein, which is involved in insulator function to limit the spread of gene activation. We identify nearly 15,000 conserved sites that likely serve as insulators, and we show that nearby genes separated by predicted CTCF sites show markedly reduced correlation in gene expression. These sites may thus partition the human genome into domains of expression.}},

Probands carry more gene-disruptive CNVs and SNVs, resulting in severe missense mutations and mapping to predicted fetal brain promoters and embryonic stem cell enhancers. These differences become more pronounced for autism genes (p = 1.8 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, OR = 2.2).

While human nonsense RNA degradation can be initiated either by an endonucleolytic cleavage event near the PTC or through decapping, the individual contribution of these activities on endogenous substrates has remained unresolved. Here we used concurrent transcriptome-wide identification of NMD substrates and their 5'-3' decay intermediates to establish that SMG6-catalyzed endonucleolysis widely initiates the degradation of human nonsense RNAs, whereas decapping is used to a lesser extent. We also show that a large proportion of genes hosting snoRNAs in their introns produce considerable amounts of NMD-sensitive splice variants, indicating that these RNAs are merely by-products of a primary snoRNA production process. Additionally, transcripts from genes encoding multiple snoRNAs often yield alternative transcript isoforms that allow for differential expression of individual coencoded snoRNAs. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that snoRNA host genes need to be highly transcribed to accommodate high levels of snoRNA production and that the expression of individual snoRNAs and their cognate spliced RNA can be uncoupled via alternative splicing and NMD.}},

We detect anomalies for 30 GEUVADIS and 16 Human Body Map samples. By correcting anomalies when possible, we reduce the number of falsely predicted instances of differential expression.

  doi = {10.1093/molbev/msw171}, 
  abstract = {{The mutation-selection model of coding sequence evolution has received renewed attention for its use in estimating site-specific amino acid propensities and selection coefficient distributions. Two computationally-tractable mutation-selection inference frameworks have been introduced: One framework employs a fixed-effects, highly-parameterized maximum likelihood approach, while the other employs a random-effects Bayesian Dirichlet Process approach. While both implementations follow the same model, they appear to make distinct predictions about the distribution of selection coefficients. The fixed-effects framework estimates a large proportion of highly deleterious substitutions, whereas the random-effects framework estimates that all substitutions are either nearly-neutral or weakly deleterious. It remains unknown, however, how accurately each method infers evolutionary constraints at individual sites. Indeed, selection coefficient distributions pool all site-specific inferences, thereby obscuring a precise assessment of site-specific estimates. Therefore, in this study, we use a simulation-based strategy to determine how accurately each approach recapitulates the selective constraint at individual sites. We find that the fixed-effects approach, despite its extensive parameterization, consistently and accurately estimates site-specific evolutionary constraint. By contrast, the random-effects Bayesian approach systematically underestimates the strength of natural selection, particularly for slowly-evolving sites. We also find that, despite the strong differences between their inferred selection coefficient distributions, the fixed- and random-effects approaches yield surprisingly similar inferences of site-specific selective constraint. We conclude that the fixed-effects mutation-selection framework provides the more reliable software platform for model application and future development.}},

Natural genetic variation can point to the possible gene regulatory function of specific sequences through their allelic associations with gene expression.

Sequence variants affecting transcription factor (TF) binding at CRMs have a strong potential to influence gene regulatory function, which provides a motivation for prioritising such variants in association testing. Here, we generate an atlas of CRMs showing predicted allelic variation in TF binding affinity in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and test their association with the expression of their putative target genes inferred inferred from Promoter Capture Hi-C and immediate linear proximity. We reveal over 1300 CRM TF-binding variants associated with target gene expression, the majority of them undetected with standard association testing.

Selection upon gene expression regulatory variation can contribute to adaptive phenotypic diversity; however, surprisingly few studies have examined how genome-wide patterns of gene expression G×E are manifested in response to environmental stress and other selective agents that cause climatic adaptation. Here, we characterize drought-responsive expression divergence between upland (drought-adapted) and lowland (mesic) ecotypes of the perennial C4 grass, Panicum hallii, in natural field conditions. Overall, we find that cis-regulatory elements contributed to gene expression divergence across 47\% of genes, 7.2\% of which exhibit drought-responsive G×E. While less well-represented, we observe 1294 genes (7.8\%) with trans effects. Trans-by-environment interactions are weaker and much less common than cis G×E, occurring in only 0.7\% of trans-regulated genes. Finally, gene expression heterosis is highly enriched in expression phenotypes with significant G×E. As such, modes of inheritance that drive heterosis, such as dominance or overdominance, may be common among G×E genes. Interestingly, motifs specific to drought-responsive transcription factors are highly enriched in the promoters of genes exhibiting G×E and trans regulation, indicating that expression G×E and heterosis may result from the evolution of transcription factors or their binding sites. P. hallii serves as the genomic model for its close relative and emerging biofuel crop, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Accordingly, the results here not only aid in the discovery of the genetic mechanisms that underlie local adaptation but also provide a foundation to improve switchgrass yield under water-limited conditions.}},

Base-resolution importance (i.e. "attribution") scores inferred from these models can highlight predictive sequence motifs and syntax. Unfortunately, these models are prone to overfitting and are sensitive to random initializations, often resulting in noisy and irreproducible attributions that obfuscate underlying motifs. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel attribution prior, where the Fourier transform of input-level attribution scores are computed at training-time, and high-frequency components of the Fourier spectrum are penalized. We evaluate different model architectures with and without attribution priors trained on genome-wide binary or continuous molecular profiles. We show that our attribution prior dramatically improves models' stability, interpretability, and performance on held-out data, especially when training data is severely limited. Our attribution prior also allows models to identify biologically meaningful sequence motifs more sensitively and precisely within individual regulatory elements. The prior is agnostic to the model architecture or predicted experimental assay, yet provides similar gains across all experiments. This work represents an important advancement in improving the reliability of deep learning models for deciphering the regulatory code of the genome.}},

  abstract = {{The influence of population size (N) on natural selection acting on alleles that affect fitness has been understood for almost a century. As N declines, genetic drift overwhelms selection and alleles with direct fitness effects are rendered neutral. Often, however, alleles experience so-called indirect selection, meaning they affect not the fitness of an individual but the fitness distribution of its offspring. Some of the best-studied examples of indirect selection include alleles that modify aspects of the genetic system such as recombination and mutation rates. Here, we use analytics, simulations, and experimental populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to examine the influence of N on indirect selection acting on alleles that increase the genomic mutation rate (mutators). Mutators experience indirect selection via genomic associations with beneficial and deleterious mutations they generate. We show that, as N declines, indirect selection driven by linked beneficial mutations is overpowered by drift before drift can neutralize the cost of the deleterious load. As a result, mutators transition from being favored by indirect selection in large populations to being disfavored as N declines. This surprising phenomenon of sign inversion in selective effect demonstrates that indirect selection on mutators exhibits a profound and qualitatively distinct dependence on N.}},

Here, we review the prospects of using molecular passport data derived from genomic sequence information as a universal monitoring tool at the single-plant level within and between genebanks. Together with recent advances in breeding methodologies, the transformation of genebanks into bio-digital resource centers will facilitate the selection of useful genetic variation and its use in breeding programs, thus providing easy access to past crop diversity. We propose linking catalogs of natural genetic variation and enquiries into biological mechanisms of plant performance as a long-term joint research goal of genebanks, plant geneticists and breeders. A Perspective on the future of agricultural genebank collections discusses how the use of molecular passport data can help facilitate genomic selection and accelerate crop breeding.}},

We characterized developmental transitions by associating spatiotemporal expression profiles with morphological changes resulting from genetic perturbations that disrupt steps in a pathway controlling branching. Developmental dynamics of genes targeted in vivo by the transcription factor RAMOSA1, a key regulator of determinacy, revealed potential mechanisms for repressing branches in distinct stem cell populations, including interactions with KNOTTED1, a master regulator of stem cell maintenance.

Nascent transcription profiling revealed that RNAPII complexes with accelerated transcription clear stalling sites at both gene ends, resulting in read-through transcription.

When repressors of transcription or mRNA and protein stability are lost, fewer errors in <i>Drosophila</i> development occur when metabolism is lowered. We demonstrate the universality of this phenomenon by eliminating the entire microRNA family of repressors and find that development to maturity can be largely rescued when metabolism is reduced. Using a mathematical model that replicates GRN dynamics, we find that lowering metabolism suppresses the emergence of developmental errors by curtailing the influence of auxiliary repressors on GRN output. We experimentally show that gene expression dynamics are less affected by loss of repressors when metabolism is reduced. Thus, layered repression provides robustness through error suppression and may provide an evolutionary route to a shorter reproductive cycle.</p>}},

  abstract = {{Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have laid the foundation for investigations into the biology of complex traits, drug development and clinical guidelines. However, the majority of discovery efforts are based on data from populations of European ancestry1–3. In light of the differential genetic architecture that is known to exist between populations, bias in representation can exacerbate existing disease and healthcare disparities. Critical variants may be missed if they have a low frequency or are completely absent in European populations, especially as the field shifts its attention towards rare variants, which are more likely to be population-specific4–10. Additionally, effect sizes and their derived risk prediction scores derived in one population may not accurately extrapolate to other populations11,12. Here we demonstrate the value of diverse, multi-ethnic participants in large-scale genomic studies. The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study conducted a GWAS of 26 clinical and behavioural phenotypes in 49,839 non-European individuals. Using strategies tailored for analysis of multi-ethnic and admixed populations, we describe a framework for analysing diverse populations, identify 27 novel loci and 38 secondary signals at known loci, as well as replicate 1,444 GWAS catalogue associations across these traits. Our data show evidence of effect-size heterogeneity across ancestries for published GWAS associations, substantial benefits for fine-mapping using diverse cohorts and insights into clinical implications. In the United States—where minority populations have a disproportionately higher burden of chronic conditions13—the lack of representation of diverse populations in genetic research will result in inequitable access to precision medicine for those with the highest burden of disease. We strongly advocate for continued, large genome-wide efforts in diverse populations to maximize genetic discovery and reduce health disparities.}},

Diverse transcript isoforms arise from the use of alternative transcription start sites, polyadenylation sites and splice sites; however, the relative contribution of these processes to isoform diversity in normal human physiology is unclear. To address this question, we investigated cell type-dependent differences in exon usage of over 18 000 protein-coding genes in 23 cell types from 798 samples of the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project. We found that about half of the expressed genes displayed tissue-dependent transcript isoforms. Alternative transcription start and termination sites, rather than alternative splicing, accounted for the majority of tissue-dependent exon usage. We confirmed the widespread tissue-dependent use of alternative transcription start sites in a second, independent dataset, Cap Analysis of Gene Expression data from the FANTOM consortium. Moreover, our results indicate that most tissue-dependent splicing involves untranslated exons and therefore may not increase proteome complexity. Thus, alternative transcription start and termination sites are the principal drivers of transcript isoform diversity across tissues, and may underlie the majority of cell type specific proteomes and functions.}},

This measure is mathematically independent from expression level and allele frequency, additive, applicable to multiallelic variants, and generalizable to multiple independent variants. We provide efficient tools and guidelines for estimating aFC from both eQTL and allelic expression data sets and apply it to Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) data. We show that aFC estimates independently derived from eQTL and allelic expression data are highly consistent, and identify technical and biological correlates of eQTL effect size. We generalize aFC to analyze genes with two eQTLs in GTEx and show that in nearly all cases the two eQTLs act independently in regulating gene expression. In summary, aFC is a solid measure of cis-regulatory effect size that allows quantitative interpretation of cellular regulatory events from population data, and it is a valuable approach for investigating novel aspects of eQTL data sets.}},

We still lack a basic comprehension of how such variables shaping cis-regulatory architecture culminate in quantitative transcriptional responses. Here we explored how such factors determine the transcriptional activity of a model transcription factor, the c-AMP Response Element (CRE) binding protein. We measured expression driven by 4,602 synthetic regulatory elements in a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) exploring the impact of CRE number, affinity, distance to the promoter, and spacing between multiple CREs. We found the number and affinity of CREs within regulatory elements largely determines overall expression, and this relationship is shaped by the proximity of each CRE to the downstream promoter. In addition, while we observed expression periodicity as the CRE distance to the promoter varied, the spacing between multiple CREs altered this periodicity. Finally, we compare library expression between an episomal MPRA and a new, genomically-integrated MPRA in which a single synthetic regulatory element is present per cell at a defined locus. We observe that these largely recapitulate each other although weaker, non-canonical CREs exhibited greater activity in the genomic context.</p>}},

Comparing RNA-seq data from 4,055 tumors and 563 normal tissues profiled in the The Cancer Genome Atlas and FANTOM5 datasets, we identified a core transcript set with theranostic potential. Our analyses also revealed enhancer RNAs, which are upregulated in cancer, defining promoters that overlap with repetitive elements (especially SINE/Alu and LTR/ERV1 elements) that are often upregulated in cancer. Lastly, we documented for the first time upregulation of multiple copies of the REP522 interspersed repeat in cancer. Overall, our genome-wide expression profiling approach identified a comprehensive set of candidate biomarkers with pan-cancer potential, and extended the perspective and pathogenic significance of repetitive elements that are frequently activated during cancer progression.

There are over 1,000 transcription factors (TFs) in vertebrates that play a role in this regulation. Determining which of these are likely to be controlling a set of genes can be assisted by computational prediction, utilising experimentally verified binding site motifs.

CiiiDER predicts transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) across regulatory regions of interest, such as promoters and enhancers derived from any species. It can perform an enrichment analysis to identify TFs that are significantly over- or under-represented in comparison to a bespoke background set and thereby elucidate pathways regulating sets of genes of pathophysiological importance.

The distribution of thirteen known CPEs across four monocots (Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa ssp. japonica, Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays) and four dicots (Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera, Glycine max) reveals the structural organization of the core promoter in relation to the TATA-box as well as with respect to other CPEs. The distribution of known CPE motifs with respect to transcription start site (TSS) exhibited positional conservation within monocots and dicots with slight differences across all eight genomes. Further, a more refined subset of annotated genes based on orthologs of the model monocot (O. sativa ssp. japonica) and dicot (A. thaliana) genomes supported the positional distribution of these thirteen known CPEs. DNA free energy profiles provided evidence that the structural properties of promoter regions are distinctly different from that of the non-regulatory genome sequence. It also showed that monocot core promoters have lower DNA free energy than dicot core promoters. The comparison of monocot and dicot promoter sequences highlights both the similarities and differences in the core promoter architecture irrespective of the species-specific nucleotide bias.

Yu et al. and Petryk et al. found in mouse and yeast, respectively, that modified histones are segregated to both DNA daughter strands in a largely symmetric manner (see the Perspective by Ahmad and Henikoff). However, the mechanisms ensuring this symmetric inheritance in yeast and mouse were different. Yeasts use subunits of DNA polymerase to prevent the lagging-strand bias of parental histones, whereas in mouse cells, the replicative helicase MCM2 counters the leading-strand bias. Science , this issue p. [1386][1], p. [1389][2]; see also p. [1311][3] During genome replication, parental histones are recycled to newly replicated DNA with their posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Whether sister chromatids inherit modified histones evenly remains unknown. We measured histone PTM partition to sister chromatids in embryonic stem cells. We found that parental histones H3-H4 segregate to both daughter DNA strands with a weak leading-strand bias, skewing partition at topologically associating domain (TAD) borders and enhancers proximal to replication initiation zones. Segregation of parental histones to the leading strand increased markedly in cells with histone-binding mutations in MCM2, part of the replicative helicase, exacerbating histone PTM sister chromatid asymmetry. This work reveals how histones are inherited to sister chromatids and identifies a mechanism by which the replication machinery ensures symmetric cell division.

Although some lncRNA loci encode RNAs that act non-locally (in trans), there is emerging evidence that many lncRNA loci act locally (in cis) to regulate the expression of nearby genes-for example, through functions of the lncRNA promoter, transcription, or transcript itself. Despite their potentially important roles, it remains challenging to identify functional lncRNA loci and distinguish among these and other mechanisms. Here, to address these challenges, we developed a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 activation screen that targets more than 10,000 lncRNA transcriptional start sites to identify noncoding loci that influence a phenotype of interest. We found 11 lncRNA loci that, upon recruitment of an activator, mediate resistance to BRAF inhibitors in human melanoma cells. Most candidate loci appear to regulate nearby genes. Detailed analysis of one candidate, termed EMICERI, revealed that its transcriptional activation resulted in dosage-dependent activation of four neighbouring protein-coding genes, one of which confers the resistance phenotype. Our screening and characterization approach provides a CRISPR toolkit with which to systematically discover the functions of noncoding loci and elucidate their diverse roles in gene regulation and cellular function.}},

The structures reveal transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), and suggest how the core and kinase TFIIH modules function in the opening of promoter DNA and the phosphorylation of Pol II, respectively. The TFIIH core subunit Ssl2 (a homologue of human XPB) is positioned on downstream DNA by the ‘E-bridge’ helix in TFIIE, consistent with TFIIE-stimulated DNA opening. The TFIIH kinase module subunit Tfb3 (MAT1 in human) anchors the kinase Kin28 (CDK7), which is mobile in the PIC but preferentially located between the Mediator hook and shoulder in the PIC–core Mediator complex. Open spaces between the Mediator head and middle modules may allow access of the kinase to its substrate, the C-terminal domain of Pol II. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the yeast pre-initiation complex (PIC) and its complex with core Mediator provide insights into the opening of promoter DNA and the initiation of transcription. To initiate gene transcription, RNA polymerase (Pol) II assembles with general transcription factors on promoter DNA to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC). Here, Patrick Cramer and colleagues describe cryo-electron microscopy structures of the yeast PIC and the PIC bound to the core Mediator (cMed) complex. The latter structure with the general coactivator Mediator has 46 factors, including all those that are essential for transcription initiation in yeast.

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0141910}, 
  abstract = {{In recent years, RNA-seq is emerging as a powerful technology in estimation of gene and/or transcript expression, and RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase per Million reads) is widely used to represent the relative abundance of mRNAs for a gene. In general, the methods for gene quantification can be largely divided into two categories: transcript-based approach and ‘union exon’-based approach. Transcript-based approach is intrinsically more difficult because different isoforms of the gene typically have a high proportion of genomic overlap. On the other hand, ‘union exon’-based approach method is much simpler and thus widely used in RNA-seq gene quantification. Biologically, a gene is expressed in one or more transcript isoforms. Therefore, transcript-based approach is logistically more meaningful than ‘union exon’-based approach. Despite the fact that gene quantification is a fundamental task in most RNA-seq studies, however, it remains unclear whether ‘union exon’-based approach for RNA-seq gene quantification is a good practice or not. In this paper, we carried out a side-by-side comparison of ‘union exon’-based approach and transcript-based method in RNA-seq gene quantification. It was found that the gene expression levels are significantly underestimated by ‘union exon’-based approach, and the average of RPKM from ‘union exons’-based method is less than 50\% of the mean expression obtained from transcript-based approach. The difference between the two approaches is primarily affected by the number of transcripts in a gene. We performed differential analysis at both gene and transcript levels, respectively, and found more insights, such as isoform switches, are gained from isoform differential analysis. The accuracy of isoform quantification would improve if the read coverage pattern and exon-exon spanning reads are taken into account and incorporated into EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm. Our investigation discourages the use of ‘union exons’-based approach in gene quantification despite its simplicity.}},

Silencers also act at multiple genes, and at the level of chromosomal domains and long-range interactions. Deletion of silencer regions linked to the drug transporter genes ABCC2 and ABCG2 caused chemo-resistance.

  abstract = {{Quantitative traits often show large variation caused by multiple genetic factors . One such trait is the chronological lifespan of non-dividing yeast cells, serving as a model for cellular aging. Screens for genetic factors involved in aging typically assay mutants of protein-coding genes. To identify natural genetic variants contributing to cellular aging, we exploited two strains of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe , that differ in chronological lifespan. We generated segregant pools from these strains and subjected them to advanced intercrossing over multiple generations to break up linkage groups. We chronologically aged the intercrossed segregant pool, followed by genome sequencing at different times to detect genetic variants that became reproducibly enriched as a function of age. A region on Chromosome II showed strong positive selection during aging. Based on expected functions, two candidate variants from this region in the long-lived strain were most promising to be causal: small insertions and deletions in the 5′-untranslated regions of ppk31 and SPBC409.08 . Ppk31 is an ortholog of [Rim15][1], a conserved kinase controlling cell proliferation in response to nutrients, while SPBC409.08 is a predicted spermine transmembrane transporter. Both [Rim15][1] and the spermine-precursor, spermidine, are implicated in aging as they are involved in autophagy-dependent lifespan extension. Single and double allele replacement suggests that both variants, alone or combined, have subtle effects on cellular longevity. Furthermore, deletion mutants of both ppk31 and SPBC409.08 rescued growth defects caused by spermidine. We propose that Ppk31 and SPBC409.08 may function together to modulate lifespan, thus linking [Rim15][1]/Ppk31 with spermidine metabolism.

Focusing on the bivalent PAX6 locus, we find that increased DNMT3B binding is associated with promoter hypermethylation, which precipitates a neural differentiation defect and failure of PAX6 induction during differentiation. dCas9-mediated locus-specific demethylation and global inactivation of DNMT3B in TKO hESCs partially reverses the hypermethylation at the PAX6 promoter and improves differentiation to neuroectoderm. Taking these findings together with further genome-wide methylation and TET1 and DNMT3B ChIP–seq analyses, we conclude that TET proteins safeguard bivalent promoters from de novo methylation to ensure robust lineage-specific transcription upon differentiation.}},

Variation in selection intensity, however, predicts larger base composition differences in highly biased loci. Greater differences in the G+C content of 34 coding regions than 46 intron sequences between D. melanogaster and D. simulans suggest that D. melanogaster has undergone a reduction in selection intensity for codon bias. Computer simulations suggest at least a fivefold reduction in Nes at silent sites in this lineage. Other classes of molecular change show lineage effects between these species. Rates of amino acid substitution are higher in the D. melanogaster lineage than in D. simulans in 14 genes for which outgroup sequences are available. Surprisingly, protein sizes are larger in D. melanogaster than in D. simulans in the 34 genes compared between the two species.

The pipeline utilizes human regulatory features identified from thousands of tissues, cell lines, and experimental assays to predict homologous regions in another mammalian species.

For FoF1-ATPases in different species, we also find apparent optimization of the number of subunits in the c-ring, which determines the number of protons pumped per ATP synthesized.

The approximate locations of these variants can be mapped as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs); however a major limitation of eQTLs is their low resolution, which precludes investigation of the causal variants and their molecular mechanisms. Here we report RNA-seq and full genome sequences for 85 diverse isolates of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae - including wild, domesticated, and human clinical strains - which allowed us to perform eQTL mapping with 50-fold higher resolution than previously possible. In addition to variants in promoters, we uncovered an important role for variants in 39 untranslated regions, especially those affecting binding of the PUF family of RNA-binding proteins. The eQTLs are predominantly under purifying selection, particularly those affecting essential genes and conserved genes. However, applying the sign test for lineage-specific selection revealed the polygenic up-regulation of dozens of biofilm suppressor genes in strains isolated from human patients, consistent with the key role of biofilms in fungal pathogenicity. In addition, a single variant in the promoter of a biofilm suppressor, NIT3, showed the strongest genome-wide association with clinical origin. Altogether our results demonstrate the power of high-resolution eQTL mapping in understanding the molecular mechanisms of regulatory variation, as well as the natural selection acting on this variation that drives adaptation to environments ranging from laboratories to vineyards to the human body.</p>}},

  abstract = {{Abstract Motivation The computational prediction of gene function is a key step in making full use of newly sequenced genomes. Function is generally predicted by transferring annotations from homologous genes or proteins for which experimental evidence exists. The ‘ortholog conjecture’ proposes that orthologous genes should be preferred when making such predictions, as they evolve functions more slowly than paralogous genes. Previous research has provided little support for the ortholog conjecture, though the incomplete nature of the data cast doubt on the conclusions. Results We use experimental annotations from over 40 000 proteins, drawn from over 80 000 publications, to revisit the ortholog conjecture in two pairs of species: (i) Homo sapiens and Mus musculus and (ii) Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. By making a distinction between questions about the evolution of function versus questions about the prediction of function, we find strong evidence against the ortholog conjecture in the context of function prediction, though questions about the evolution of function remain difficult to address. In both pairs of species, we quantify the amount of information that would be ignored if paralogs are discarded, as well as the resulting loss in prediction accuracy. Taken as a whole, our results support the view that the types of homologs used for function transfer are largely irrelevant to the task of function prediction. Maximizing the amount of data used for this task, regardless of whether it comes from orthologs or paralogs, is most likely to lead to higher prediction accuracy.

We found no polymorphism within D. melanogaster and a single polymorphism within D. simulans; divergence between the species was about 5\%. Comparison with the alcohol dehydrogenase gene and its two flanking regions in D. melanogaster, for which comparable data are available, revealed a statistically significant departure from neutrality in all three tests. This lack of polymorphism in the ciD locus may reflect recent positive selective sweeps on the fourth chromosome with extreme hitchhiking generated by the lack of recombination. By simulation, we estimate there to be a 50\% chance that the selective sweeps occurred within the past 30,000 years in D. melanogaster and 75,000 in D. simulans.}},

These genes show differences in their patterns of transcription initiation, and have been reported to have higher levels of some activation-associated chromatin modifications. Here we report that genes with CpG island promoters have a characteristic transcription-associated chromatin organization. This signature includes high levels of the transcription elongation-associated histone modifications H4K20me1, H2BK5me1 and H3K79me1/2/3 in the 5' end of the gene, depletion of the activation marks H2AK5ac, H3K14ac and H3K23ac immediately downstream of the transcription start site (TSS), and characteristic epigenetic asymmetries around the TSS. The chromosome organization factor CTCF may be bound upstream of RNA polymerase in most active CpG island promoters, and an unstable nucleosome at the TSS may be specifically marked by H4K20me3, the first example of such a modification. H3K36 monomethylation is only detected as enriched in the bodies of active genes that have CpG island promoters. Finally, as expression levels increase, peak modification levels of the histone methylations H3K9me1, H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K27me1 shift further away from the TSS into the gene body. These results suggest that active genes with CpG island promoters have a distinct step-like series of modified nucleosomes after the TSS. The identity, positioning, shape and relative ordering of transcription-associated histone modifications differ between genes with and without CpG island promoters. This supports a model where chromatin organization reflects not only transcription activity but also the type of promoter in which transcription initiates.}},

We established the effect of each introgression on the transcriptome and identified approximately 7,200 eQTL regulating the steady-state transcript levels of 5,300 genes. Barnes-Hut t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding clustering identified 42 modules revealing novel associations between transcript level patterns and biological processes. The results showed a complex genetic architecture of global transcript abundance pattern in tomato. Several genetic hot spots regulating a large number of transcript level patterns relating to diverse biological processes such as plant defense and photosynthesis were identified. Important eQTL regulating transcript level patterns were related to leaf number and complexity as well as hypocotyl length. Genes associated with leaf development showed an inverse correlation with photosynthetic gene expression, but eQTL regulating genes associated with leaf development and photosynthesis were dispersed across the genome. This comprehensive eQTL analysis details the influence of these loci on plant phenotypes and will be a valuable community resource for investigations on the genetic effects of eQTL on phenotypic traits in tomato.}},

The strength and regulation of transcription can be modulated by a variety of factors including TFBS composition, TFBS affinity and number, distance between TFBSs, distance of TFBSs to transcription start sites, and epigenetic modifications. We still lack a basic comprehension of how such variables shaping cis-regulatory architecture culminate in quantitative transcriptional responses. Here we explored how such factors determine the transcriptional activity of a model transcription factor, the c-AMP Response Element (CRE) binding protein. We measured expression driven by 4,602 synthetic regulatory elements in a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) exploring the impact of CRE number, affinity, distance to the promoter, and spacing between multiple CREs. We found the number and affinity of CREs within regulatory elements largely determines overall expression, and this relationship is shaped by the proximity of each CRE to the downstream promoter. In addition, while we observed expression periodicity as the CRE distance to the promoter varied, the spacing between multiple CREs altered this periodicity. Finally, we compare library expression between an episomal MPRA and a new, genomically-integrated MPRA in which a single synthetic regulatory element is present per cell at a defined locus. We observe that these largely recapitulate each other although weaker, non-canonical CREs exhibited greater activity in the genomic context.}},

Nonetheless, there is an Achilles' heel exposed by all of the genomic data that has accrued: We still do not know how to interpret them. Many genes are subject to sophisticated programs of transcriptional regulation, mediated by DNA sequences that harbor binding sites for transcription factors, which can up- or down-regulate gene expression depending upon environmental conditions. This gives rise to an input-output function describing how the level of expression depends upon the parameters of the regulated gene-for instance, on the number and type of binding sites in its regulatory sequence. In recent years, the ability to make precision measurements of expression, coupled with the ability to make increasingly sophisticated theoretical predictions, has enabled an explicit dialogue between theory and experiment that holds the promise of covering this genomic Achilles' heel. The goal is to reach a predictive understanding of transcriptional regulation that makes it possible to calculate gene expression levels from DNA regulatory sequence. This review focuses on the canonical simple repression motif to ask how well the models that have been used to characterize it actually work. We consider a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated experiments in which the minimal parameter set learned at one level is applied to make quantitative predictions at the next. We show that these careful quantitative dissections provide a template for a predictive understanding of the many more complex regulatory arrangements found across all domains of life.}},

We developed a sensitive computational method to identify CRE combinations with conserved spacing that does not require genome alignments. When applied to 7 sensu stricto and sensu lato Saccharomyces species, 80\% of the predicted interactions displayed some evidence of combinatorial transcriptional behavior in several existing datasets including 1) chromatin immunoprecipitation data for co-localization of transcription factors, 2) gene expression data for co-expression of predicted regulatory targets, and 3) gene ontology databases for common pathway membership of predicted regulatory targets. We tested several predicted CRE interactions with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in a wild-type strain and strains in which a predicted cofactor was deleted. Our experiments confirmed that TF occupancy at the promoters of the CRE combination target genes depends on the predicted cofactor while occupancy of other promoters is independent of the predicted cofactor. Our method has the additional advantage of identifying regulatory differences between species. By analyzing the S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus genomes, we identified differences in combinatorial cis-regulation between the species and showed that the predicted changes in gene regulation explain several of the species-specific differences seen in gene expression datasets. In some instances, the same CRE combinations appear to regulate genes involved in distinct biological processes in the two different species. The results of this research demonstrate 1) that combinatorial cis-regulation can be inferred by multi- genome analysis and 2) that combinatorial cis-regulation can explain differences in gene expression between species.}},

  abstract = {{Considerable interest is focused on the use of polymorphism data to identify regions of the genome that underlie recent adaptations. These searches are guided by a simple model of positive selection, in which a mutation is favored as soon as it arises. This assumption may not be realistic, as environmental changes and range expansions may lead previously neutral or deleterious alleles to become beneficial. We examine what effect this mode of selection has on patterns of variation at linked neutral sites by implementing a new coalescent model of positive directional selection on standing variation. In this model, a neutral allele arises and drifts in the population, then at frequency f becomes beneficial, and eventually reaches fixation. Depending on the value of f, this scenario can lead to a large variance in allele frequency spectra and in levels of linkage disequilibrium at linked, neutral sites. In particular, for intermediate f, the beneficial substitution often leads to a loss of rare alleles--a pattern that differs markedly from the signature of directional selection currently relied on by researchers. These findings highlight the importance of an accurate characterization of the effects of positive selection, if we are to reliably identify recent adaptations from polymorphism data.}},

Probabilistic assumptions for the distribution of the data, i.e. for the observed positions of the mapped reads, as well as for systematic errors, i.e. for reads which map closely but not exactly to a real TSS, are made and can be adapted by the user. The framework also comprises a regularization procedure which can be applied as a preprocessing step to decrease the noise and thereby reduce the number of false predictions.}},

Next-generation sequencing has made major strides in the past decade. Studies based on large sequencing data sets are growing in number, and public archives for raw sequencing data have been doubling in size every 18 months. Leveraging these data requires researchers to use large-scale computational resources. Cloud computing, a model whereby users rent computers and storage from large data centres, is a solution that is gaining traction in genomics research. Here, we describe how cloud computing is used in genomics for research and large-scale collaborations, and argue that its elasticity, reproducibility and privacy features make it ideally suited for the large-scale reanalysis of publicly available archived data, including privacy-protected data.}},

  abstract = {{A major question in human genetics is how sequence variants of broadly expressed genes produce tissue- and cell type-specific molecular phenotypes. Genetic variation of alternative splicing is a prevalent source of transcriptomic and proteomic diversity in human populations. We investigated splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) in 1,209 samples from 13 human brain regions, using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and genotype data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Hundreds of sQTLs were identified in each brain region. Some sQTLs were shared across brain regions, whereas others displayed regional specificity. These “regionally ubiquitous” and “regionally specific” sQTLs showed distinct positional distributions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and outside essential splice sites, respectively, suggesting their regulation by distinct molecular mechanisms. Integrating the binding motifs and expression patterns of RNA binding proteins with exon splicing profiles, we uncovered likely causal variants underlying brain region-specific sQTLs. Notably, SNP rs17651213 created a putative binding site for the splicing factor RBFOX2 and was associated with increased splicing of MAPT exon 3 in cerebellar tissues, where RBFOX2 was highly expressed. Overall, our study reveals a more comprehensive spectrum and regional variation of sQTLs in human brain and demonstrates that such regional variation can be used to fine map potential causal variants of sQTLs and their associated neurological diseases.}},

Genomic sequencing studies have highlighted key differences between pediatric and adult cancers.

Also noteworthy is the remarkable heterogeneity in the types of genetic alterations that likely drive the growth of pediatric cancers, including copy number alterations, gene fusions, enhancer hijacking events, and chromoplexy. Because most studies have genetically profiled pediatric cancers only at diagnosis, the mechanisms underlying tumor progression, therapy resistance, and metastasis remain poorly understood. We discuss evidence that points to a need for more integrative approaches aimed at identifying driver events in pediatric cancers at both diagnosis and relapse. We also provide an overview of key aspects of germline predisposition for cancer in this age group.</p>}},

Nascent transcription assays are a relatively new set of high throughput techniques that measure the location of actively engaged RNA polymerase genome wide. Hence, nascent transcription is a rich source of information on the regulation of RNA polymerase activity. To fully dissect this data requires the development of stochastic models that can both deconvolve the stages of polymerase activity and identify significant changes in activity between experiments.

RESULTS:We present a generative, probabilistic model of RNA polymerase that fully describes loading, initiation, elongation and termination. We fit this model genome wide and profile the enzymatic activity of RNA polymerase across various loci and following experimental perturbation. We observe striking correlation of predicted loading events and regulatory chromatin marks. We provide principled statistics that compute probabilities reminiscent of traveler's and divergent ratios. We finish with a systematic comparison of RNA Polymerase activity at promoter versus non-promoter associated loci.

To study the potentially pathogenic consequences of balanced chromosomal rearrangements, we generated a series of genomic inversions by placing an active limb enhancer cluster from the Epha4 regulatory domain at different positions within a neighbouring gene-dense region and investigated their effects on gene regulation in vivo in mice. Expression studies and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture from embryonic limb buds showed that the enhancer cluster activated several genes downstream that are located within asymmetric regions of contact, the so-called architectural stripes3. The ectopic activation of genes led to a limb phenotype that could be rescued by deleting the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) anchor of the stripe. Architectural stripes appear to be driven by enhancer activity, because they do not form in mouse embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, we show that architectural stripes are a frequent feature of developmental three-dimensional genome architecture often associated with active enhancers. Therefore, balanced chromosomal rearrangements can induce ectopic gene expression and the formation of asymmetric chromatin contact patterns that are dependent on CTCF anchors and enhancer activity. Kraft et al. show that chromosomal inversions that relocate a limb enhancer can establish asymmetric stripes of the enhancer with downstream genes, resulting in ectopic gene expression and limb phenotypes.}},

Typically, thousands of genes are affected, and the functions of these rhythms include preparing and adjusting various physiological functions in tissues to meet time-of-day dependent requirements optimally. The controllers of the rhythms are often transcription factors (proteins which regulate transcription), which are relatively well known. However, there is a layer between transcription factor action and transcriptional activity whose role in circadian transcription has not previously been characterized: the core promoter. The core promoter acts as a template for the assembly of the intricate machinery that governs initiation of transcription. There are different types of core promoters that are typically used for different types of genes. It is not known which types of core promoters are used for the rhythmically induced genes. Here, it is shown that there are specific characteristics of core promoters driving rhythmic transcription in mice and flies. Furthermore, it is shown that there is a class of strong circadian promoters in mice that drive strong rhythms with very intense average transcriptional rates. These results help understanding the regulatory systems governing circadian transcription, and ultimately, aid the understanding of many diseases resulting from disturbed circadian rhythms.}},

  abstract = {{<p>Transcription of developmental genes is controlled by multiple enhancers. Frequently, more than one enhancer can activate transcription from the same promoter in the same cells. In these cases, how is regulatory information from multiple enhancers combined to determine the overall expression output of their shared promoter? To investigate this question, we quantified nascent transcription driven by a pair shadow enhancers, each individual of the pair, and their duplications in Drosophila embryos using live imaging. This set of constructs allows us to quantify the "computation" made by the pairs of enhancers: their combined output expression as a function of the expression that they drive separately. We show that the computation performed by these shadow enhancers and duplications varies across the expression pattern, implying that how their activities are combined depends on the transcriptional regulators bound to the enhancers in different parts of the embryo. Characterizing the computation made by multiple enhancers is a critical first step in developing conceptual and computational models of gene expression at the locus level, where multiple enhancers collaborate.</p>}},

Our data set is produced using the paired-end analysis of transcription start sites (PEAT) protocol, providing millions of TSS locations from wild-type Columbia-0 Arabidopsis thaliana whole root samples. Using this data set, we grouped TSS reads into "TSS tag clusters" and categorized clusters into three spatial initiation patterns: narrow peak, broad with peak, and weak peak. We then designed a machine learning model that predicts the presence of TSS tag clusters with outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all three initiation patterns. We used this model to analyze the transcription factor binding site content of promoters exhibiting these initiation patterns. In contrast to the canonical notions of TATA-containing and more broad "TATA-less" promoters, the model shows that, in plants, the vast majority of transcription start sites are TATA free and are defined by a large compendium of known DNA sequence binding elements.

Most proteins do not bind only a single sequence, but rather a set of sequences, which may be modeled by a sequence motif. Algorithms for de novo motif discovery differ in their promoter models, learning approaches, and other aspects, but typically use the statistically simple position weight matrix model for the motif, which assumes statistical independence among all nucleotides. However, there is no clear justification for that assumption, leading to an ongoing debate about the importance of modeling dependencies between nucleotides within binding sites. In the past, modeling statistical dependencies within binding sites has been hampered by the problem of limited data. With the rise of high-throughput technologies such as ChIP-seq, this situation has now changed, making it possible to make use of statistical dependencies effectively. In this work, we investigate the presence of statistical dependencies in binding sites of the human enhancer-blocking insulator protein CTCF by using the recently developed model class of inhomogeneous parsimonious Markov models, which is capable of modeling complex dependencies while avoiding overfitting. These findings lead to a more detailed characterization of the CTCF binding motif, which is only poorly represented by independent nucleotide frequencies at several positions, predominantly at the 3' end.}},

Whether the two different types of mutations have different effects in non-protein-coding sequences remains unknown. Genetic variants primarily impact gene expression by disrupting the binding of transcription factors (TFs) and other DNA-binding proteins. Because Tv’s cause larger changes in the shape of a DNA backbone, we hypothesized that Tv’s would have larger impacts on TF binding and gene expression. Here, we provide multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that Tv’s have larger impacts on regulatory DNA including analyses of TF binding motifs and allele-specific TF binding. In these analyses, we observed a depletion of Tv’s within TF binding motifs and TF binding sites. Using massively parallel population-scale reporter assays, we also provided empirical evidence that Tv’s have larger effects than Ts’s on the activity of human gene regulatory elements. Tv’s are more likely to disrupt TF binding, resulting in larger changes in gene expression. Although the observed differences are small, these findings represent a novel, fundamental property of regulatory variation.

Sequence variants affecting transcription factor (TF) binding at CRMs have a strong potential to influence gene regulatory function, which provides a motivation for prioritising such variants in association testing. Here, we generate an atlas of CRMs showing predicted allelic variation in TF binding affinity in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and test their association with the expression of their putative target genes inferred inferred from Promoter Capture Hi-C and immediate linear proximity.

Existing evidence indicates that populations harbor extensive genetic variation in promoter sequences, that a substantial fraction of this variation has consequences for both biochemical and organismal phenotype, and that some of this functional variation is sorted by selection. As with protein-coding sequences, rates and patterns of promoter sequence evolution differ considerably among loci and among clades for reasons that are not well understood. Studying the evolution of transcriptional regulation poses empirical and conceptual challenges beyond those typically encountered in analyses of coding sequence evolution: promoter organization is much less regular than that of coding sequences, and sequences required for the transcription of each locus reside at multiple other loci in the genome. Because of the strong context-dependence of transcriptional regulation, sequence inspection alone provides limited information about promoter function. Understanding the functional consequences of sequence differences among promoters generally requires biochemical and in vivo functional assays. Despite these challenges, important insights have already been gained into the evolution of transcriptional regulation, and the pace of discovery is accelerating.}},

We tested this idea by analyzing cell-specific gene expression across spermatogenesis in two lineages of house mice and their sterile and fertile reciprocal hybrids. We found pervasive disruption of sex chromosome gene expression in sterile hybrids at every stage of spermatogenesis. Failure of MSCI was developmentally preceded by increased silencing of autosomal genes, supporting the hypothesis that divergence at the hybrid incompatibility gene, Prdm9, results in increased rates of autosomal asynapsis which in turn triggers widespread silencing of unsynapsed chromatin. We also detected opposite patterns of postmeiotic overexpression or hyper-repression of the sex chromosomes in reciprocal hybrids, supporting the hypothesis that genomic conflict has driven functional divergence that leads to deleterious X-Y dosage imbalances in hybrids. Our developmental timeline also exposed more subtle patterns of mitotic misregulation on the X chromosome, a previously undocumented stage of spermatogenic disruption in this cross. These results indicate that multiple hybrid incompatibilities have converged on a common regulatory phenotype, the disrupted expression of the sex chromosomes during spermatogenesis. Collectively, these data reveal a composite regulatory basis to hybrid male sterility in mice that helps resolve the mechanistic underpinnings of the well-documented large X-effect in mice speciation. We propose that the inherent sensitivity of spermatogenesis to X-linked regulatory disruption has the potential to be a major driver of reproductive isolation in species with chromosomal sex determination.}},

Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown. To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions.}},

The sex of the offspring is environmentally determined and mediated via endocrine signalling by the mother. Interestingly, male and female Daphnia can be genetically identical, yet display large differences in behaviour, morphology, lifespan and metabolic activity. Our goal was to integrate multiple omics datasets, including gene expression, splicing, histone modification and DNA methylation data generated from genetically identical female and male Daphnia pulex under controlled laboratory settings with the aim of achieving a better understanding of the underlying epigenetic factors that may contribute to the phenotypic differences observed between the two genders. In this study we demonstrate that gene expression level is positively correlated with increased DNA methylation, and histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) at predicted promoter regions. Conversely, elevated histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), distributed across the entire transcript length, is negatively correlated with gene expression level. Interestingly, male Daphnia are dominated with epigenetic modifications that globally promote elevated gene expression, while female Daphnia are dominated with epigenetic modifications that reduce gene expression globally. For examples, CpG methylation (positively correlated with gene expression level) is significantly higher in almost all differentially methylated sites in male compared to female Daphnia. Furthermore, H3K4me3 modifications are higher in male compared to female Daphnia in more than 3/4 of the differentially regulated promoters. On the other hand, H3K27me3 is higher in female compared to male Daphnia in more than 5/6 of differentially modified sites. However, both sexes demonstrate roughly equal number of genes that are up-regulated in one gender compared to the other sex. Since, gene expression analyses typically assume that most genes are expressed at equal level among samples and different conditions, and thus cannot detect global changes affecting most genes. The epigenetic differences between male and female in Daphnia pulex are vast and dominated by changes that promote elevated gene expression in male Daphnia. Furthermore, the differences observed in both gene expression changes and epigenetic modifications between the genders relate to pathways that are physiologically relevant to the observed phenotypic differences.}},

Training on both genomes improves gene expression prediction accuracy on held out sequences. We further demonstrate a novel and powerful transfer learning approach to use mouse regulatory models to analyze human genetic variants associated with molecular phenotypes and disease. Together these techniques unleash thousands of non-human epigenetic and transcriptional profiles toward more effective investigation of how gene regulation affects human disease.}},

  abstract = {{<h3>Summary</h3> <p>Imprinted genes are expressed from a single parental allele. In mammals, this unusual mode of transcription generally depends on the epigenetic silencing of one allele by DNA methylation (DNAme) established in the germline. While many species-specific imprinted orthologues have been documented in eutherians, the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolutionary switch from biallelic to imprinted expression are currently unknown. During mouse oogenesis, gametic differentially methylated regions (gDMRs) acquire DNAme in a process guided by transcription. Here we show that transcription initiating in proximal lineage-specific endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) is likely responsible for DNAme established in oocytes at 4/6 mouse-specific and 17/110 human-specific maternal imprinted gDMRs (igDMRs). The latter can be further divided into Catarrhini (Old World monkeys and apes)- or Hominoidea (ape)-specific igDMRs, which are embedded within transcription units initiating in ERVs specific to these primate lineages. Using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, we deleted the relevant murine-specific ERVs upstream of the maternally methylated genes <i>Impact</i> and <i>Slc38a4</i>. Strikingly, imprinting at these genes was lost in the offspring of females harboring these deletions and biallelic expression was observed. Our work reveals a novel evolutionary mechanism whereby maternally silenced genes arise from biallelically expressed progenitors.</p>}},

However, accumulating experimental evidence demonstrates that many of the arguments against a role for proteins in the evolution of gene regulation, and the developmental evolution in general, are no longer supported and there is an increasing number of cases in which transcription factor protein changes have been demonstrated in evolution. Here, we review the evidence that cis-regulatory evolution is an important driver of phenotypic evolution and provide examples of protein-mediated developmental evolution.

It enables to view time-lapse microscopy data as many experiments performed on one cell rather than one experiment performed on many cells. By harnessing existing cell-to-cell differences, one can then learn how environmental cues affect (non-observed) intracellular processes. Our approach is generic and enables to exploit in unprecedented manner the high informative content of single-cell longitudinal data.}},

  abstract = {{The Drosophila genome activator Vielfaltig (Vfl), also known as Zelda (Zld), is thought to prime enhancers for activation by patterning transcription factors (TFs). Such priming is accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we analyze the effect of Zld on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and binding of the patterning TF Dorsal (Dl). Our results show that early enhancers are characterized by an intrinsically high nucleosome barrier. Zld tackles this nucleosome barrier through local depletion of nucleosomes with the effect being dependent on the number and position of Zld motifs. Without Zld, Dl binding decreases at enhancers and redistributes to open regions devoid of enhancer activity. We propose that Zld primes enhancers by lowering the high nucleosome barrier just enough to assist TFs in accessing their binding motifs and promoting spatially controlled enhancer activation if the right patterning TFs are present. We envision that genome activators in general will utilize this mechanism to activate the zygotic genome in a robust and precise manner.}},

Although associated with accelerated repair of Pol II-encountered lesions and limited mutagenesis, it is still unclear how this mechanism is maintained during recovery from genotoxic stress. Here we uncover a surprising widespread gain in chromatin accessibility and preservation of the active histone mark H3K27ac after UV-irradiation. We show that the concomitant increase in Pol II release from promoter-proximal pause (PPP) sites of most active genes, PROMoter uPstream Transcripts (PROMPTs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) favors unrestrained initiation, as demonstrated by the synthesis of short nascent RNAs, including TSS-associated RNAs (start-RNAs). In accordance, drug-inhibition of the transition into elongation replenished the post-UV reduced levels of pre-initiating pol II at TSSs. Continuous engagement of new Pol II thus ensures maximal transcription-driven DNA repair of active genes and non-coding regulatory loci. Together, our results reveal an unanticipated layer regulating the UV-triggered transcriptional-response and provide physiologically relevant traction to the emerging concept that transcription initiation rate is determined by pol II pause-release dynamics.}},

Here, we carry out a detailed study of the alternatively spliced gene products annotated in the ENCODE pilot project. We find that alternative splicing in human genes is more frequent than has commonly been suggested, and we demonstrate that many of the potential alternative gene products will have markedly different structure and function from their constitutively spliced counterparts. For the vast majority of these alternative isoforms, little evidence exists to suggest they have a role as functional proteins, and it seems unlikely that the spectrum of conventional enzymatic or structural functions can be substantially extended through alternative splicing.}},

  abstract = {{Identifying active regulatory elements and their molecular signatures is critical to understand gene regulatory mechanisms and subsequently better delineating biological mechanisms of complex diseases and traits. Studies have shown that active enhancers can be transcribed into enhancer RNA (eRNA). Here, we identify actively transcribed regulatory elements in human pancreatic islets by generating eRNA profiles using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) across 70 islet samples. We identify 9,954 clusters of CAGE tag transcription start sites (TSS) or tag clusters (TCs) in islets, ∼20\% of which are islet-specific when compared to CAGE TCs across publicly available tissues. Islet TCs are most enriched to overlap genome wide association study (GWAS) loci for islet-relevant traits such as fasting glucose. We integrated islet CAGE profiles with diverse epigenomic information such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) profiles of five histone modifications and accessible chromatin profiles from the assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq), to understand how the underlying islet chromatin landscape is associated with TSSs. We identify that ATAC-seq informed transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TF ‘footprint’ motifs) for the RFX TF family are highly enriched in transcribed regions occurring in enhancer chromatin states, whereas TF footprint motifs for the ETS family are highly enriched in transcribed regions within promoter chromatin states. Using massively parallel reporter assays in a rat pancreatic islet beta cell line, we tested the activity of 3,378 islet CAGE elements and found that 2,279 (∼67.5\%) show significant regulatory activity (5\% FDR). We find that TCs within accessible enhancer show higher enrichment to overlap T2D GWAS loci than accessible enhancer annotations alone, suggesting that TC annotations pinpoint active regions within the enhancer chromatin states.

We investigate the effect of mapping and alignment on the accuracy of transcript quantification in both simulated and experimental data, as well as the effect on subsequent differential gene expression analysis. We observe that, even when the quantification model itself is held fixed, the effect of choosing a different alignment methodology, or aligning reads using different parameters, on quantification estimates can sometimes be large, and can affect downstream analyses as well. These effects can go unnoticed when assessment is focused too heavily on simulated data, where the alignment task is often simpler than in experimentally-acquired samples.

In addition, we developed a robust and unbiased computational pipeline that simultaneously identifies putative subtype-specific enhancers and their cognate TFs by integrating the magnitude of enhancer transcription, TF mRNA expression levels, TF motif p-values, and enrichment of H3K4me1 and H3K27. When applied across the 13 different cell lines noted above, the Total Functional Score of Enhancer Elements (TFSEE) identified key breast cancer subtype-specific TFs that act at transcribed enhancers to dictate gene expression patterns determining growth outcomes, including Forkhead TFs, FOSL1, and PLAG1.

We show that these distributions are satisfactorily explained by a simple process in which individuals randomly copy names from each other, a process that is analogous to the infinite-allele model of population genetics with random genetic drift. By its simplicity, this model provides a powerful null hypothesis for cultural change. It further explains why a few elements inevitably become highly popular, even if they have no intrinsic superiority over alternatives.

  abstract = {{Gene regulation shapes the evolution of phenotypic diversity. We investigated the evolution of liver promoters and enhancers in six primate species using ChIP-seq (H3K27ac and H3K4me1) to profile cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and using RNA-seq to characterize gene expression in the same individuals. To quantify regulatory divergence, we compared CRE activity across species by testing differential ChIP-seq read depths directly measured for orthologous sequences. We show that the primate regulatory landscape is largely conserved across the lineage, with 63\% of the tested human liver CREs showing similar activity across species. Conserved CRE function is associated with sequence conservation, proximity to coding genes, cell-type specificity, and transcription factor binding. Newly evolved CREs are enriched in immune response and neurodevelopmental functions. We further demonstrate that conserved CREs bind master regulators, suggesting that while CREs contribute to species adaptation to the environment, core functions remain intact. Newly evolved CREs are enriched in young transposable elements (TEs), including Long-Terminal-Repeats (LTRs) and SINE-VNTR-Alus (SVAs), that significantly affect gene expression. Conversely, only 16\% of conserved CREs overlap TEs. We tested the cis-regulatory activity of 69 TE subfamilies by luciferase reporter assays, spanning all major TE classes, and showed that 95.6\% of tested TEs can function as either transcriptional activators or repressors. In conclusion, we demonstrated the critical role of TEs in primate gene regulation and illustrated potential mechanisms underlying evolutionary divergence among the primate species through the noncoding genome.}},

Our results globally show that the release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase into elongation functions as a critical switch at which a gene’s response to stress is determined. Highly transcribed and highly inducible genes display strong transcriptional directionality and selective assembly of general transcription factors on the core sense promoter. Heat-induced transcription at enhancers, instead, correlates with prior binding of cell-type, sequence-specific transcription factors. Activated Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) binds to transcription-primed promoters and enhancers, and CTCF-occupied, non-transcribed chromatin. These results reveal chromatin architectural features that orient transcription at divergent regulatory elements and prime transcriptional responses genome-wide. Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) is a regulator of stress-induced transcription. Here, the authors investigate changes to transcription and chromatin organization upon stress and find that activated HSF1 binds to transcription-primed promoters and enhancers, and to CTCF occupied, untranscribed chromatin.}},

Genomic and epigenomic classification of these lncRNAs reveals that most intergenic lncRNAs originate from enhancers rather than from promoters.

Using end-enriched RNA-sequencing (Rend-seq) with single-nucleotide resolution, we found that many bacterial gene clusters encoding conserved pathways have undergone massive divergence in transcript abundance and architectures via remodeling of internal promoters and terminators. Remarkably, these evolutionary changes are compensated post-transcriptionally to maintain preferred stoichiometry of protein synthesis rates. Even more strikingly, in eukaryotic budding yeast, functionally analogous proteins that arose independently from bacterial counterparts also evolved to convergent in-pathway expression. The broad requirement for exact protein stoichiometries despite regulatory divergence provides an unexpected principle for building biological pathways both in nature and for synthetic activities.}},

  abstract = {{Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that causes malignant and inflammatory diseases in ∼10\% of infected people. A typical host has between 10(4) and 10(5) clones of HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes, each clone distinguished by the genomic integration site of the single-copy HTLV-1 provirus. The HTLV-1 bZIP (HBZ) factor gene is constitutively expressed from the minus strand of the provirus, whereas plus-strand expression, required for viral propagation to uninfected cells, is suppressed or intermittent in vivo, allowing escape from host immune surveillance. It remains unknown what regulates this pattern of proviral transcription and latency. Here, we show that CTCF, a key regulator of chromatin structure and function, binds to the provirus at a sharp border in epigenetic modifications in the pX region of the HTLV-1 provirus in T cells naturally infected with HTLV-1. CTCF is a zinc-finger protein that binds to an insulator region in genomic DNA and plays a fundamental role in controlling higher order chromatin structure and gene expression in vertebrate cells. We show that CTCF bound to HTLV-1 acts as an enhancer blocker, regulates HTLV-1 mRNA splicing, and forms long-distance interactions with flanking host chromatin. CTCF-binding sites (CTCF-BSs) have been propagated throughout the genome by transposons in certain primate lineages, but CTCF binding has not previously been described in present-day exogenous retroviruses. The presence of an ectopic CTCF-BS introduced by the retrovirus in tens of thousands of genomic locations has the potential to cause widespread abnormalities in host cell chromatin structure and gene expression.}},

Interrogating tissues from species across the eukaryotic kingdoms identified unstable transcripts resembling enhancer RNAs, pri-miRNAs, antisense transcripts, and promoter upstream transcripts in multicellular animals, plants, and fungi spanning 1.6 million years of evolution. Integration of epigenomic data from these organisms revealed that histone H3 trimethylation (H3K4me3) was largely confined to TSSs of stable transcripts, whereas H3K27ac marked nucleosomes downstream from all active TSSs, suggesting an ancient role for posttranslational histone modifications in transcription. Our findings show that total RNA is sufficient to identify transcribed regulatory elements and capture the dynamics of initiated stable and unstable transcripts at single-nucleotide resolution in eukaryotes.}},

Our study determined the set of SEs in pluripotent state cells and adult zebrafish tissues and revealed both similarities and differences between zebrafish and mammalian SEs. Although the total number of SEs was proportional to the genome size, the genomic distribution of zebrafish SEs differed from that of the mammalian SEs. Despite the evolutionary distance separating zebrafish and mammals and the low overall SE sequence conservation, ∼42\% of zebrafish SEs were located in close proximity to orthologs that also were associated with SEs in mouse and human. Compared to their nonassociated counterparts, higher sequence conservation was revealed for those SEs that have maintained orthologous gene associations. Functional dissection of two of these SEs identified conserved sequence elements and tissue-specific expression patterns, while chromatin accessibility analyses predicted transcription factors governing the function of pluripotent state zebrafish SEs. Our zebrafish annotations and comparative studies show the extent of SE usage and their conservation across vertebrates, permitting future gene regulatory studies in several tissues.}},

To enrich for enhancer-promoter interactions, a mechanism through which GWAS variation may target genes, we captured loops associated with H3K27Ac histone, characteristic of promoters and enhancers. Analysis of HiChIP loops contacting promoters revealed enrichment for endometrial cancer GWAS heritability and intersection with endometrial cancer risk variation identified 103 HiChIP target genes at 13 risk loci. Expression of four HiChIP target genes (<i>SNX11 </i>, <i>SRP14</i>, <i>HOXB2</i> and <i>BCL11A</i>) was associated with risk variation, providing further evidence for their regulation. Network analysis functionally prioritized a set of proteins that interact with those encoded by HiChIP target genes, and this set was enriched for pan-cancer and endometrial cancer drivers. Lastly, HiChIP target genes and prioritized interacting proteins were over-represented in pathways related to endometrial cancer development. In summary, we have generated the first global chromatin looping data from endometrial cells, enabling analysis of all known endometrial cancer risk loci and identifying biologically relevant candidate target genes.</p>}},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The initiating nucleotide found at the 5' end of primary transcripts has a distinctive triphosphorylated end that distinguishes these transcripts from all other RNA species. Recognizing this distinction is key to deconvoluting the primary transcriptome from the plethora of processed transcripts that confound analysis of the transcriptome. The currently available methods do not use targeted enrichment for the 5'end of primary transcripts, but rather attempt to deplete non-targeted RNA.

RESULTS:We developed a method, Cappable-seq, for directly enriching for the 5' end of primary transcripts and enabling determination of transcription start sites at single base resolution. This is achieved by enzymatically modifying the 5' triphosphorylated end of RNA with a selectable tag. We first applied Cappable-seq to E. coli, achieving up to 50 fold enrichment of primary transcripts and identifying an unprecedented 16539 transcription start sites (TSS) genome-wide at single base resolution. We also applied Cappable-seq to a mouse cecum sample and identified TSS in a microbiome.

CONCLUSIONS:Cappable-seq allows for the first time the capture of the 5' end of primary transcripts. This enables a unique robust TSS determination in bacteria and microbiomes.  In addition to and beyond TSS determination, Cappable-seq depletes ribosomal RNA and reduces the complexity of the transcriptome to a single quantifiable tag per transcript enabling digital profiling of gene expression in any microbiome.}},

We generate a dataset for this purpose using i) de novo mutations from mutation accumulation experiments and ii) extremely rare polymorphisms from natural populations. The first, mutation accumulation (MA) lines, are the product of maintaining flies in tiny populations for many generations, therefore rendering natural selection ineffective and allowing new mutations to accrue in the genome. The second, rare genetic variation from natural populations, allows the study of mutation because very rare polymorphisms are relatively unaffected by the filter of natural selection. We use both methods in Drosophila melanogaster, first generating our own novel dataset of sequenced MA lines as well as performing a meta-analysis of all published MA mutations to-date (∼2,000 events), and then second we identify a high quality set of extremely rare (<=0.1\%) polymorphisms that are fully validated with resequencing (∼70,000 events). We use these datasets to precisely measure mutational rates and patterns. Highlights of our results include: a high rate of multi-nucleotide mutation events at both short (∼5bp) and long (∼1kb) genomic distances, finding that mutation drives GC content ￼lower in already GC-poor regions, and using our precise context-dependent mutation rates to predict long-term evolutionary patterns at synonymous sites.

A variety of core promoter elements exists; however for most of these motifs, the distribution across species is unknown. Here we report on the comparison of human and amphibian promoter sequences. We have used oligo-capping in combination with deep sequencing to determine transcription start sites in Xenopus tropicalis. To systematically predict regulatory elements, we have developed a de novo motif finding pipeline using an ensemble of computational tools. A comprehensive comparison of human and amphibian promoter sequences revealed both similarities and differences in core promoter architecture. Some of the differences stem from a highly divergent nucleotide composition of Xenopus and human promoters. Whereas the distribution of some core promoter motifs is conserved independently of species-specific nucleotide bias, the frequency of another class of motifs correlates with the single nucleotide frequencies. This class includes the well-known TATA box and SP1 motifs, which are more abundant in Xenopus and human promoters, respectively. While these motifs are enriched above the local nucleotide background in both organisms, their frequency varies in step with this background. These differences are likely adaptive as these motifs can recruit TFIID to either CpG island or sharply initiating promoters. Our results highlight both the conserved and diverged aspects of vertebrate transcription, most notably showing co-opted motif usage to recruit the transcriptional machinery to promoters with diverging nucleotide composition. This shows how sweeping changes in nucleotide composition are compatible with highly conserved mechanisms of transcription initiation.}},

Variability in TSS selection has been proposed to involve DNA 'scrunching' and 'anti-scrunching,' the hallmarks of which are: (i) forward and reverse movement of the RNAP leading edge, but not trailing edge, relative to DNA, and (ii) expansion and contraction of the transcription bubble.

In obligately sexual organisms, meiotic recombination is the dominant force separating linked variants from one another, and thus in determining the decay of LD with physical distance. In facultatively sexual diploid organisms that principally reproduce clonally, mechanisms of mitotic exchange are expected to become relatively more important in shaping LD. Here we outline mathematical and computational models of a facultative-sex coalescent process that includes meiotic and mitotic recombination, via both crossovers and gene conversion, to determine how LD is affected with facultative sex. We demonstrate that the degree to which LD is broken down by meiotic recombination simply scales with the probability of sex if it is sufficiently high (much greater than 1/N for N the population size). However, with very rare sex (occurring with frequency on the order of 1/N), mitotic gene conversion plays a particularly important and complicated role because it both breaks down associations between sites and removes within-individual diversity. Strong population structure under rare sex leads to lower average LD values than in panmictic populations, due to the influence of low-frequency polymorphisms created by allelic sequence divergence acting in individual subpopulations. These analyses provide information on how to interpret observed LD patterns in facultative sexuals, and determine what genomic forces are likely to shape them.}},

  abstract = {{<p>Transcription initiates at both coding and non-coding genomic elements, including mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) core promoters and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, each class has different expression profiles with lncRNAs and eRNAs being the most tissue-specific. How these complex differences in expression profiles and tissue-specificities are encoded in a single DNA sequence, however, remains unresolved. Here, we address this question using computational approaches and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) surveying hundreds of promoters and enhancers. We find that both divergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters have higher capacities to drive transcription than non-divergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters, respectively. Conversely, lincRNAs and eRNAs have lower capacities to drive transcription and are more tissue-specific than divergent genes. This higher tissue-specificity is strongly associated with having less complex TF motif profiles at the core promoter. We experimentally validated these findings by testing both engineered single-nucleotide deletions and human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MPRA. In both cases, we observe that single nucleotides associated with many motifs are important drivers of promoter activity. Thus, we suggest that high TF motif density serves as a robust mechanism to increase promoter activity at the expense of tissue-specificity. Moreover, we find that 22\% of common SNPs in core promoter regions have significant regulatory effects. Collectively, our findings show that high TF motif density provides redundancy and increases promoter activity at the expense of tissue specificity, suggesting that specificity of expression may be regulated by simplicity of motif usage.</p>}},

Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility.

In his highly prescient book, Susumu Ohno recognized that duplicate genes are fixed and maintained within a population with 3 distinct outcomes: neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, and conservation of function. Subsequent researchers have proposed a multitude of population genetic models that lead to these outcomes, each differing largely in the role played by adaptive natural selection. In this paper, I present a nonmathematical review of these models, their predictions, and the evidence collected in support of each of them. Though the various outcomes of gene duplication are often strictly associated with the presence or absence of adaptive natural selection, I argue that determining the outcome of duplication is orthogonal to determining whether natural selection has acted. Despite an ever-growing field of research into the fate of gene duplicates, there is not yet clear evidence for the preponderance of one outcome over the others, much less evidence for the importance of adaptive or nonadaptive forces in maintaining these duplicates.}},

  abstract = {{MOTIVATION:The protein-DNA interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs, also known as DNA motifs) are critical activities in gene transcription. The identification of the DNA motifs is a vital task for downstream analysis. Unfortunately, the long-range coupling information between different DNA motifs is still lacking. To fill the void, as the first-of-its-kind study, we have identified the coupling DNA motif pairs on long-range chromatin interactions in human.

RESULTS:The coupling DNA motif pairs exhibit substantially higher DNase accessibility than the background sequences. Half of the DNA motifs involved are matched to the existing motif databases, although nearly all of them are enriched with at least one gene ontology term. Their motif instances are also found statistically enriched on the promoter and enhancer regions. Especially, we introduce a novel measurement called motif pairing multiplicity which is defined as the number of motifs that are paired with a given motif on chromatin interactions. Interestingly, we observe that motif pairing multiplicity is linked to several characteristics such as regulatory region type, motif sequence degeneracy, DNase accessibility, and pairing genomic distance. Taken into account together, we believe the coupling DNA motif pairs identified in this study can shed lights on the gene transcription mechanism under long-range chromatin interactions.

AVAILABILITY:The identified motif pair data is compressed and available in the supplementary materials associated with this manuscript.

The impact of this mechanism on the proteome and whether it is positively exploited in normal organismal responses remain unclear. We found that the plant photoreceptor phytochrome induces genome-wide changes in alternative promoter selection in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through this mechanism, protein isoforms with different N termini are produced that display light-dependent differences in localization. For instance, shade-grown plants accumulate a cytoplasmic isoform of glycerate kinase (GLYK), an essential photorespiration enzyme that was previously thought to localize exclusively to the chloroplast. Cytoplasmic GLYK constitutes a photorespiratory bypass that alleviates fluctuating light-induced photoinhibition. Therefore, phytochrome controls alternative promoter selection to modulate protein localization in response to changing light conditions. This study suggests that alternative promoter usage represents another ubiquitous layer of gene expression regulation in eukaryotes that contributes to diversification of the proteome.}},

Whereas driver mutations in protein-coding genes can be distinguished from passenger mutations based on their recurrence, non-coding mutations are usually not recurrent at the same position. Therefore, it is still unclear how to identify cis-regulatory driver mutations, particularly when chromatin data from the same patient is not available, thus relying only on sequence and expression information. Here we use machine-learning methods to predict functional regulatory regions using sequence information alone, and compare the predicted activity of the mutated region with the reference sequence. This way we define the Predicted Regulatory Impact of a Mutation in an Enhancer (PRIME). We find that the recently identified driver mutation in the TAL1 enhancer has a high PRIME score, representing a "gain-of-target" for MYB, whereas the highly recurrent TERT promoter mutation has a surprisingly low PRIME score. We trained Random Forest models for 45 cancer-related transcription factors, and used these to score variations in the HeLa genome and somatic mutations across more than five hundred cancer genomes. Each model predicts only a small fraction of non-coding mutations with a potential impact on the function of the encompassing regulatory region. Nevertheless, as these few candidate driver mutations are often linked to gains in chromatin activity and gene expression, they may contribute to the oncogenic program by altering the expression levels of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.}},

Two key tasks are typically carried out for motifs in the context of the analysis of genomic sequences. These are: identification in a set of DNA regions of over-represented motifs from a particular motif database, and de novo discovery of over-represented motifs. Here we describe existing methodology to perform these two tasks for motifs characterizing transcription factor binding. When applied to the output of ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo experiments, or to promoter regions of co-modulated genes, motif analysis techniques allow for the prediction of transcription factor binding events and enable identification of transcriptional regulators and co-regulators. The usefulness of motif analysis is further exemplified in this review by how motif discovery improves peak calling in ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo experiments and, when coupled with information on gene expression, allows insights into physical mechanisms of transcriptional modulation.}},

We prioritized causal variants within disease- or trait-associated loci from all publicly available genome-wide association studies and experimentally validated predictions for four immune-related diseases.

This enables probing of evolutionary constraints on gene expression and ab initio prediction of mutation disease effects, making ExPecto an end-to-end computational framework for the in silico prediction of expression and disease risk.}},

In this issue ofGenes \& Development, two studies (Henriques and colleagues [pp. 26-41] and Mikhaylichenko and colleagues [pp. 42-57]) shine new light on the transcriptional nature of promoters and enhancers inDrosophilaTogether, these studies support recent work in mammalian cells that indicates that most active enhancers drive local transcription using factors and mechanisms similar to those of promoters. Intriguingly, enhancer transcription is shown to be coordinated by SPT5- and P-TEFb-mediated pause-release, but the pause half-life is shorter, and termination is more rapid at enhancers than at promoters. Moreover, bidirectional transcription from promoters is associated with enhancer activity, lending further credence to models in which regulatory elements exist along a spectrum of promoter-ness and enhancer-ness. We propose a general unified model to explain possible functions of transcription at enhancers.}},

Their sites of initiation are generally inferred from transcript 5' ends and are thought to be either locally dispersed or focused. How these two modes of initiation relate is unclear. Here, we apply permanganate treatment and chromatin immunoprecipitation (PIP-seq) of initiation factors to identify the precise location of melted DNA separately associated with the preinitiation complex (PIC) and the adjacent paused complex (PC). This approach revealed the two known modes of transcription initiation. However, in contrast to prevailing views, they co-occurred within the same promoter region: initiation originating from a focused PIC, and broad nucleosome-linked initiation. PIP-seq allowed transcriptional orientation of Pol II to be determined, which may be useful near promoters where sufficient sense/anti-sense transcript mapping information is lacking. PIP-seq detected divergently oriented Pol II at both coding and noncoding promoters, as well as at enhancers. Their occupancy levels were not necessarily coupled in the two orientations. DNA sequence and shape analysis of initiation complex sites suggest that both sequence and shape contribute to specificity, but in a context-restricted manner. That is, initiation sites have the locally "best" initiator (INR) sequence and/or shape. These findings reveal a common core to pervasive Pol II initiation throughout the human genome.}},

In this paper, we report an entirely new phenomenon acting on the evolution of gene regulatory sequences. We show that in a small genomic region around genes there is a selection pressure to increase expression, such that stronger enhancers are favored. This leads to an open-ended escalation of enhancer strength. This outcome is not a particular case and we expect it to occur for all genes in nearly all eukaryotic diploid organisms. We also show that this escalation is not stopped by stabilizing selection on expression profiles. Indeed, regulators may coevolve to maintain optimal phenotypes despite the enhancer strength escalation. This widespread phenomenon can significantly shift our understanding of gene regulatory regions and opens a wide array of possible tests.}},

Improving the ability of TRNs to successfully predict known regulator-target relationships in model species will enhance confidence in applying these approaches to determine regulator-target interactions in non-model species where experimental validation is challenging. Many transcriptional profiling experiments are performed across multiple time points; therefore we sought to improve regulator-target predictions by adjusting how time is incorporated into the network. We created ExRANGES , which incorporates Expression in a Rate-Normalized GEne Specific manner that adjusts how expression data is provided to the network algorithm. We tested this on a two different network construction approaches and found that ExRANGES prioritizes targets differently than traditional expression and improves the ability of these networks to accurately predict known regulator targets. ExRANGES improved the ability to correctly identify targets of transcription factors in large data sets in four different model systems: mouse, human, Arabidopsis, and yeast.

This complicates the mapping of TSSs, leading to a lack of available TSS mapping data for these genes. We used growth at low temperature and nuclear isolation to enrich for transcripts still containing outrons, applying a modified SAGE capture procedure and high-throughput sequencing to characterize 5' termini in this transcript population. We report from this data both a landscape of 5'-end utilization for C. elegans and a representative collection of TSSs for 7351 trans-spliced genes. TSS distributions for individual genes were often dispersed, with a greater average number of TSSs for trans-spliced genes, suggesting that trans-splicing may remove selective pressure for a single TSS. Upstream of newly defined TSSs, we observed well-known motifs (including TATAA-box and SP1) as well as novel motifs. Several of these motifs showed association with tissue-specific expression and/or conservation among six worm species. Comparing TSS features between trans-spliced and non-trans-spliced genes, we found stronger signals among outron TSSs for preferentially positioning of flanking nucleosomes and for downstream Pol II enrichment.

This labeling allows one to pool several samples into one sequencing flow cell, increasing the data throughput of sequencing and takes advantage of the increasing throughput of current sequences. Here, we report TS artifacts that form owing to a process called strand invasion.

More proximal pausing is associated with less complete capping, less elongation and a more enhancer-like complement of transcription factors than later pausing. Unexpectedly, transcription start sites (TSSs) are predominantly found in constellations composed of multiple divergent pairs. TSS clusters are intimately associated with precise arrays of nucleosomes and correspond with boundaries of transcription factor binding and chromatin modification at promoters and enhancers.

We observed that raising contact frequencies increases burst fraction but not burst size. In cells in which two developmentally distinct LCR-regulated globin genes are cotranscribed in cis, burst sizes of both genes are comparable. However, allelic co-transcription of both genes is statistically disfavored, suggesting mutually exclusive LCR-gene contacts.

Genes involved in light sensing and ABA signaling were some of the most differently connected genes between the C3 and CAM Erycina species, in agreement with the contrasting diel patterns of stomatal conductance in C3 and CAM plants.

For each candidate, the gene model was refined, and we conducted an analysis of sequence divergence from homologues from other taxa.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION:We found that some immune pathways, in particular the TOLL pathway, are fairly well conserved between insects and Daphnia, while other elements, in particular antimicrobial peptides, could not be recovered from the genome sequence. We also found considerable variation in gene family copy number when comparing Daphnia to insects and present phylogenetic analyses to shed light on the evolution of a range of conserved immune gene families.}},

These patterns are predicted to be mainly controlled by MBNL1 and involve multiple cancer drivers, including the mitotic gene NUMA1 We show that NUMA1 alternative splicing induces enhanced cell proliferation and centrosome amplification in nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Our study uncovers novel splicing networks that potentially contribute to cancer development and progression.}},

We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some likely to be non-causal, owing to sharing of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization with expression data from non-trait-related tissues or cell types, owing to substantial cross-cell-type variation in expression levels and eQTL strengths. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes more accurately than simple baselines. We suggest best practices for causal-gene prioritization with TWAS and discuss future opportunities for improvement. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using eQTL datasets to determine causal genes at GWAS loci.}},

The traditional methylation/deamination/mutation hypothesis for the rarity of CG does not adequately account for the observed deficiencies in certain sequences, notably the mitochondrial genomes, yeast, and Neurospora crassa, which lack the standard CpG methylase. Homodinucleotides (AA.TT, CC.GG) and larger homooligonucleotides are over-represented in many organisms, perhaps due to polymerase slippage events. For trinucleotides, GCA.TGC tends to be under-represented in phage, human viral, and eukaryotic sequences, and CTA.TAG is strongly under-represented in many prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral sequences. The CCA.TGG triplet is ubiquitously over-represented in human viral and eukaryotic sequences. Among the tetranucleotides, several four-base-pair palindromes tend to be under-represented in phage sequences, probably as a means of restriction avoidance. The tetranucleotide CTAG is observed to be rare in virtually all bacterial genomes and some phage genomes.

Here, we study how cis-regulatory variation modifies the penetrance of coding variants. Using functional genomic and genetic data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), we observed that in the general population, purifying selection has depleted haplotype combinations predicted to increase pathogenic coding variant penetrance. Conversely, in cancer and autism patients, we observed an enrichment of penetrance increasing haplotype configurations for pathogenic variants in disease-implicated genes, providing evidence that regulatory haplotype configuration of coding variants affects disease risk. Finally, we experimentally validated this model by editing a Mendelian single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using CRISPR/Cas9 on distinct expression haplotypes with the transcriptome as a phenotypic readout. Our results demonstrate that joint regulatory and coding variant effects are an important part of the genetic architecture of human traits and contribute to modified penetrance of disease-causing variants. Analysis of GTEx, cancer and autism data sets shows that cis-regulatory variation can modify the penetrance of coding variants. Deleterious coding variants on regulatory haplotypes resulting in high expression are enriched in disease cohorts and selected against in general populations.}},

While the role of accessibility in shaping TF-binding landscapes is well recorded, its role in evolutionary divergence of TF binding, which in turn can alter cis-regulatory activities, is not well understood. In this work, we studied the evolution of genome-wide binding landscapes of five major transcription factors (TFs) in the core network of mesoderm specification, between D. melanogaster and D. virilis, and examined its relationship to accessibility and sequence-level changes. We generated chromatin accessibility data from three important stages of embryogenesis in both D. melanogaster and D. virilis, and recorded conservation and divergence patterns. We then used multi-variable models to correlate accessibility and sequence changes to TF binding divergence. We found that accessibility changes can in some cases, e.g., for the master regulator Twist and for earlier developmental stages, more accurately predict binding change than is possible using TF binding motif changes between orthologous enhancers. Accessibility changes also explain a significant portion of the co-divergence of TF pairs. We noted that accessibility and motif changes offer complementary views of the evolution of TF binding, and developed a combined model that captures the evolutionary data much more accurately than either view alone. Finally, we trained machine learning models to predict enhancer activity from TF binding, and used these functional models to argue that motif and accessibility-based predictors of TF binding change can substitute for experimentally measured binding change, for the purpose of predicting evolutionary changes in enhancer activity.}},

Commonly used RNA-seq aligners rely on the consensus splice site dinucleotide motifs to map reads across splice junctions.

We developed and evaluated an approach to identify 'hidden' splicing variations in personal transcriptomes, by mapping personal RNA-seq data to personal genomes. Computational analysis and experimental validation indicate that this approach identifies personal specific splice junctions at a low false positive rate. Applying this approach to an RNA-seq data set of 75 individuals, we identified 506 personal specific splice junctions, among which 437 were novel splice junctions not documented in current human transcript annotations. 94 splice junctions had splice site SNPs associated with GWAS signals of human traits and diseases. These involve genes whose splicing variations have been implicated in diseases (such as OAS1), as well as novel associations between alternative splicing and diseases (such as ICA1). Collectively, our work demonstrates that the personal genome approach to RNA-seq read alignment enables the discovery of a large but previously unknown catalog of splicing variations in human populations.}},

Here, we present motif enrichment in differential elements of accessibility (MEDEA), a computational tool that analyzes high-throughput chromatin accessibility genomic data to identify cell-type-specific accessible regions and lineage-specific motifs associated with TF binding therein. To benchmark MEDEA, we used a panel of reference cell lines profiled by ENCODE and curated by the ENCODE Project Consortium for the ENCODE-DREAM Challenge. By comparing results with RNA-seq data, ChIP-seq peaks, and DNase-seq footprints, we show that MEDEA improves the detection of motifs associated with known lineage specifiers. We then applied MEDEA to 610 ENCODE DNase-seq data sets, where it revealed significant motifs even when absolute enrichment was low and where it identified novel regulators, such as NRF1 in kidney development. Finally, we show that MEDEA performs well on both bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq data. MEDEA is publicly available as part of our Glossary-GENRE suite for motif enrichment analysis.}},

  abstract = {{Somatic cells can accumulate mutations over the course of an individual's lifetime. This generates cells that differ genetically at specific loci within the genome. To explore how this genetic diversity in individuals contributes to disease, Yizhak et al. developed a method to detect mutations from RNA sequencing data (see the Perspective by Tomasetti). Applying this method to Cancer Genome Atlas samples and normal samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project generated a tissue-specific study of mutation accumulation. Somatic mutations were detected in nearly all individuals and across many normal human tissues in genomic regions called cancer hotspots and in genes that play a role in cancer. Interestingly, the skin, lung, and esophagus exhibited the most mutations, suggesting that the environment generates many human mutations. Science , this issue p. [eaaw0726][1]; see also p. [938][2] \#\#\# INTRODUCTION Cancer genome studies have contributed to the analysis and discovery of somatic mutations that drive cancer growth. However, studying the genetic makeup of a tumor when it is already fully developed limits our ability to uncover how and which somatic mutations accumulate in normal tissues in the stages preceding cancer initiation. To address this challenge, recent studies performed deep sequencing in a limited number of tissue types and a small number of individuals, identifying a large number of microscopic clones carrying somatic mutations, some in known cancer genes. These findings emphasize the need to uncover the genomic events that occur in all normal tissues. Although efforts have begun to collect and analyze DNA from normal tissues, we still lack a comprehensive catalog of genetic events and clonal properties across a large number of tissues and individuals. By analyzing the information-rich content in RNA now available from recent advances in RNA sequencing methods, we may be able to substantially expand the scope and scale of these studies. \#\#\# RATIONALE Some mutations found in the DNA can be detected in the corresponding RNA, depending on the mutation allele fraction and sequence coverage. We therefore hypothesized that a careful analysis of RNA sequences from normal bulk tissues could uncover somatic mutations reflecting macroscopic clones within the samples. In this work, we used the large collection of RNA sequences from the Genotype–Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, representing more than 6700 samples from \textbackslashtextasciitilde500 individuals, spanning across 29 different normal tissues. \#\#\# RESULTS We developed a new method, called RNA-MuTect, to identify somatic mutations using a tissue-derived RNA sample and its matched-normal DNA. We validated RNA-MuTect on both tumor-adjacent and cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), wherein DNA and RNA were coextracted from the same samples. Focusing on mutations contained within sufficiently covered sequences, RNA-MuTect achieved high sensitivity and precision, enabling the discovery of most driver events and mutational processes from TCGA tumor RNA data. When applied to the GTEx dataset of normal tissues, multiple somatic mutations were detected in almost all individuals and tissues studied here, including in known cancer genes. The three tissues with the largest number of somatic mutations were sun-exposed skin, esophagus mucosa, and lung; this finding suggests that environmental exposure can promote somatic mosaicism. Both the individuals’ age and tissue-specific proliferation rate were found to be associated with the number of detected mutations. A dN/dS (ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions) analysis suggested that some of the mutations identified in cancer genes may confer a selective advantage. In addition, allelic imbalance events at the chromosome arm level were detected in normal tissues. \#\#\# CONCLUSION Genetic clones carrying somatic mutations are detected across normal tissues to different extents, and these differences depend on factors such as the tissue’s exposure to environmental mutagens, natural architecture, proliferation rate, and the microenvironment. Some of these clones may be the result of genetic drift. Others, however, may develop as a result of positive selection driven by certain somatic events, thus potentially representing the earliest stages of tumorigenesis. Higher-resolution studies of normal tissues and precancerous lesions are required if we are to advance our understanding of both aging and early cancer development. ![Figure][3]</img> Somatic clonal expansions in normal human tissues. RNA sequences from 29 normal human tissues collected as part of the Genotype–Tissue Expression (GTEx) project are analyzed using RNA-MuTect, a method developed for detecting somatic mutations in RNA-seq data. Macroscopic clonal expansions, characterized by shared somatic mutations, are detected in all tissues; skin, esophagus, and lung have the largest number of somatic mutations. How somatic mutations accumulate in normal cells is poorly understood. A comprehensive analysis of RNA sequencing data from \textbackslashtextasciitilde6700 samples across 29 normal tissues revealed multiple somatic variants, demonstrating that macroscopic clones can be found in many normal tissues. We found that sun-exposed skin, esophagus, and lung have a higher mutation burden than other tested tissues, which suggests that environmental factors can promote somatic mosaicism. Mutation burden was associated with both age and tissue-specific cell proliferation rate, highlighting that mutations accumulate over both time and number of cell divisions. Finally, normal tissues were found to harbor mutations in known cancer genes and hotspots. This study provides a broad view of macroscopic clonal expansion in human tissues, thus serving as a foundation for associating clonal expansion with environmental factors, aging, and risk of disease.

  abstract = {{Bacteria and archaea typically possess small genomes that are tightly packed with protein-coding genes. The compactness of prokaryotic genomes is commonly perceived as evidence of adaptive genome streamlining caused by strong purifying selection in large microbial populations. In such populations, even the small cost incurred by nonfunctional DNA because of extra energy and time expenditure is thought to be sufficient for this extra genetic material to be eliminated by selection. However, contrary to the predictions of this model, there exists a consistent, positive correlation between the strength of selection at the protein sequence level, measured as the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates, and microbial genome size. Here, by fitting the genome size distributions in multiple groups of prokaryotes to predictions of mathematical models of population evolution, we show that only models in which acquisition of additional genes is, on average, slightly beneficial yield a good fit to genomic data. These results suggest that the number of genes in prokaryotic genomes reflects the equilibrium between the benefit of additional genes that diminishes as the genome grows and deletion bias (i.e., the rate of deletion of genetic material being slightly greater than the rate of acquisition). Thus, new genes acquired by microbial genomes, on average, appear to be adaptive. The tight spacing of protein-coding genes likely results from a combination of the deletion bias and purifying selection that efficiently eliminates nonfunctional, noncoding sequences.}},

  abstract = {{MOTIVATION:With the rapid emergence of technologies for locating cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) genome-wide, the next pressing challenge is to assign precise functions to each CRM, i.e., to determine the spatiotemporal domains or cell-types where it drives expression. A popular approach to this task is to model the typical k-mer composition of a set of CRMs known to drive a common expression pattern, and assign that pattern to other CRMs exhibiting a similar k-mer composition. This approach does not rely on prior knowledge of TFs relevant to the CRM or their binding motifs, and is thus more widely applicable than motif-based methods for predicting CRM activity, but is also prone to false positive predictions.

RESULTS:We present a novel strategy to improve the above-mentioned approach: to predict if a CRM drives a specific gene expression pattern, assess not only how similar the CRM is to other CRMs with similar activity but also to CRMs with distinct activities. We use a state-of-the-art statistical method to quantify a CRM's sequence similarity to many different training sets of CRMs, and employ a classification algorithm to integrate these similarity scores into a single prediction of the CRM's activity. This strategy is shown to significantly improve CRM activity prediction over current approaches.

  abstract = {{RNA profiling is an excellent phenotype of cellular responses and tissue states, but can be costly to generate at the massive scale required for studies of regulatory circuits, genetic states or perturbation screens. Here, we draw on a series of advances over the last decade in the field of mathematics to establish a rigorous link between biological structure, data compressibility, and efficient data acquisition. We propose that very few random composite measurements - in which gene abundances are combined in a random linear combination - are needed to approximate the high-dimensional similarity between any pair of gene abundance profiles. We then show how finding latent, sparse representations of gene expression data would enable us to 'decompress' a small number of random composite measurements and recover high-dimensional gene expression levels that were not measured (unobserved). We present a new algorithm for finding sparse, modular structure, which improves the ability to interpret samples in terms of small numbers of active modules, and show that the modular structure we find is sufficient to recover gene expression profiles from composite measurements (with \textbackslashtextasciitilde100-fold fewer composite measurements than genes). Moreover, the knowledge that sparse, modular structures exist allows us to recover expression profiles from composite measurements, even without access to any training data. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept experiment for making composite measurements in the laboratory, involving the measurement of linear combinations of RNA abundances. Altogether, our results suggest new compressive modalities in experimental biology that can form a foundation for massive scaling in high-throughput measurements, while also offering new insights into the interpretation of high-dimensional data.

Previous efforts to understand the evolution of enhancers in primates have typically studied many enhancers at low resolution, or single enhancers at high resolution. Although comparative genomic studies reveal large-scale turnover of enhancers, a specific understanding of the molecular steps by which mammalian or primate enhancers evolve remains elusive. We identified candidate hominoid-specific liver enhancers from H3K27ac ChIP-seq data. After locating orthologs in 11 primates spanning around 40 million years, we synthesized all orthologs as well as computational reconstructions of 9 ancestral sequences for 348 active tiles of 233 putative enhancers. We concurrently tested all sequences for regulatory activity with STARR-seq in HepG2 cells. We observe groups of enhancer tiles with coherent trajectories, most of which can be potentially explained by a single gain or loss-of-activity event per tile. We quantify the correlation between the number of mutations along a branch and the magnitude of change in functional activity. Finally, we identify 84 mutations that correlate with functional changes; these are enriched for cytosine deamination events within CpGs. We characterized the evolutionary-functional trajectories of hundreds of liver enhancers throughout the primate phylogeny. We observe subsets of regulatory sequences that appear to have gained or lost activity. We use these data to quantify the relationship between sequence and functional divergence, and to identify CpG deamination as a potentially important force in driving changes in enhancer activity during primate evolution.}},

  abstract = {{Gene expression differences between species are driven by both cis and trans effects. Whereas cis effects are caused by genetic variants in close proximity to the target gene, trans effects are due to distal genetic variants that affect diffusible elements such as transcription factors. Previous studies have mostly assessed the impact of cis and trans effects at the gene level. However, how cis and trans effects differentially impact regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters remains poorly understood. Here, we used massively parallel reporter assays to directly measure cis and trans effects between human and mouse embryonic stem cells at thousands of individual regulatory elements. Our approach revealed that cis effects are widespread across regulatory elements, and the strongest cis effects are associated with the disruption of motifs recognized by strong transcriptional activators. Conversely, we found that trans effects are rare but stronger in enhancers than promoters, and can be attributed to a subset of transcription factors that are differentially expressed between human and mouse. While previous studies have found extensive co-occurrence of cis and trans effects in opposite directions that stabilize gene expression throughout evolution, we find that cis-trans compensation is uncommon within individual regulatory elements. Thus, our results are consistent with a model wherein compensatory cis-trans effects at the gene level are explained by cis and trans effects that separately impact several regulatory elements rather than cis-trans effects that occur simultaneously within a single regulatory element. Together, these results indicate that studying the evolution of individual regulatory elements is pivotal to understand the tempo and mode of gene expression evolution.}},

We first discuss polysomal profiling, a classical technique that involves the separation of mRNAs depending on the number of bound ribosomes using a sucrose gradient, and which has been combined with global analysis tools such as DNA microarrays or high-throughput RNA sequencing to identify the RNAs in polysomal fractions. We then introduce ribosomal profiling, a recently established technique that enables the mapping of ribosomes along mRNAs at near-nucleotide resolution on a global scale. We finally refer to ribosome affinity purification techniques that are based on the cell-type-specific expression of tagged ribosomal proteins, allowing the capture of translatomes from specialized cells in organisms. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these three main techniques in the pursuit of defining the translatome, and we speculate about future developments.}},

Furthermore, variants creating uORFs that overlap the CDS show signals of selection equivalent to coding loss-of-function variants, and uORF-perturbing variants are under strong selection when arising upstream of known disease genes and genes intolerant to loss-of-function variants. Finally, we identify specific genes where perturbation of uORFs is likely to represent an important disease mechanism, and report a novel uORF frameshift variant upstream of NF2 in families with neurofibromatosis. Our results highlight uORF-perturbing variants as an important and under-recognised functional class that can contribute to penetrant human disease, and demonstrate the power of large-scale population sequencing data to study the deleteriousness of specific classes of non-coding variants.</p>}},

  abstract = {{<p>Identifying cancer-relevant mutations in noncoding regions is extremely challenging due to the large numbers of such mutations, their low levels of recurrence, and the general difficulty in interpreting their impact. To uncover genes that are dysregulated due to somatic mutations in cis, we introduce the concept of differential allele-specific expression (ASE) and develop methods to identify genes within an individual9s cancer whose ASE differs from what is found in matched normal tissue. When applied to breast cancer tumor samples, our methods readily detect the known allele-specific effects of copy number variation and nonsense mediated decay. Further, genes that are found to recurrently exhibit differential ASE across samples are cancer relevant. Genes with cis mutations are enriched for differential ASE, and we find 147 potentially functional noncoding mutations cis to genes that exhibit significant differential ASE. Overall, our results suggest that differential ASE is a promising means for discovering gene dysregulation within an individual due to cis noncoding mutations.</p>}},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The FANTOM5 consortium used Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) tag sequencing to produce a comprehensive atlas of promoters and enhancers within the human and mouse genomes. We reasoned that the mapping of these regulatory elements to the pig genome could provide useful annotation and evidence to support assignment of orthology.

RESULTS:For human transcription start sites (TSS) associated with annotated human-mouse orthologs, 17\% mapped to the pig genome but not to the mouse, 10\% mapped only to the mouse, and 55\% mapped to both pig and mouse. Around 17\% did not map to either species. The mapping percentages were lower where there was not clear orthology relationship, but in every case, mapping to pig was greater than to mouse, and the degree of homology was also greater. Combined mapping of mouse and human CAGE-defined promoters identified at least one putative conserved TSS for >16,000 protein-coding genes. About 54\% of the predicted locations of regulatory elements in the pig genome were supported by CAGE and/or RNA-Seq analysis from pig macrophages.

CONCLUSIONS:Comparative mapping of promoters and enhancers from humans and mice can provide useful preliminary annotation of other animal genomes. The data also confirm extensive gain and loss of regulatory elements between species, and the likelihood that pigs provide a better model than mice for human gene regulation and function.}},

  abstract = {{Empirical studies have revealed that regulatory DNA sequences such as enhancers or promoters often harbor multiple binding sites for the same transcription factor. Such “homotypic site clustering” has been hypothesized as arising out of functional requirements of the sequences. Here, we propose an alternative explanation of this phenomenon that multisite enhancers are common because they are favored by evolutionary sampling of the genotype–phenotype landscape. To test this hypothesis, we developed a new computational framework specialized for population genetic simulations of enhancer evolution. It uses a thermodynamics-based model of enhancer function, integrating information from strong as well as weak binding sites, to determine the strength of selection. Using this framework, we found that even when simpler genotypes exist for a desired strength of regulation, relatively complex genotypes (enhancers with more sites) are more readily reached by the simulated evolutionary process. We show that there are more ways to “build” a fit genotype with many weak sites than with a few strong sites, and this is why evolution finds complex genotypes more often. Our claims are consistent with an empirical analysis of binding site content in enhancers characterized in Drosophila melanogaster and their orthologs in other Drosophila species. We also characterized a subtle but significant difference between genotypes likely to be sampled by evolution and equally fit genotypes one would obtain by uniform sampling of the fitness landscape, that is, an “evolutionary signature” in enhancer sequences. Finally, we investigated potential effects of other factors, such as rugged fitness landscapes, short local duplications, and noise characteristics of enhancers, on the emergence of homotypic site clustering. Homotypic site clustering is an important contributor to the complexity and function of cis-regulatory sequences. This work provides a simple null hypothesis for its origin, against which alternative adaptationist explanations may be evaluated, and cautions against “evolutionary mirages” present in common features of genomic sequence. The quantitative framework we develop here can be used more generally to understand how mechanisms of enhancer action influence their composition and evolution.}},

  abstract = {{Heat shock drives the expression of transcripts that bypass mRNA quality control for direct export and translation, allowing cells to survive extreme situations at the cost of accuracy. Under normal conditions, newly made messenger RNAs are bound by adapter proteins and then the export protein Mex67, before being transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Heike Krebber and colleagues find that the pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is abbreviated under heat-shock conditions, when translation is shifted in favour of a subset of proteins—heat-shock proteins. The authors show that these proteins bypass adapter binding and quality control mechanisms to immediately recruit Mex67. This facilitates a rapid export of these transcripts to where they can be translated, and protect the cell from stress. Cells grow well only in a narrow range of physiological conditions. Surviving extreme conditions requires the instantaneous expression of chaperones that help to overcome stressful situations. To ensure the preferential synthesis of these heat-shock proteins, cells inhibit transcription, pre-mRNA processing and nuclear export of non-heat-shock transcripts, while stress-specific mRNAs are exclusively exported and translated1. How cells manage the selective retention of regular transcripts and the simultaneous rapid export of heat-shock mRNAs is largely unknown. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the shuttling RNA adaptor proteins Npl3, Gbp2, Hrb1 and Nab2 are loaded co-transcriptionally onto growing pre-mRNAs. For nuclear export, they recruit the export-receptor heterodimer Mex67–Mtr2 (TAP–p15 in humans)2. Here we show that cellular stress induces the dissociation of Mex67 and its adaptor proteins from regular mRNAs to prevent general mRNA export. At the same time, heat-shock mRNAs are rapidly exported in association with Mex67, without the need for adapters. The immediate co-transcriptional loading of Mex67 onto heat-shock mRNAs involves Hsf1, a heat-shock transcription factor that binds to heat-shock-promoter elements in stress-responsive genes. An important difference between the export modes is that adaptor-protein-bound mRNAs undergo quality control, whereas stress-specific transcripts do not. In fact, regular mRNAs are converted into uncontrolled stress-responsive transcripts if expressed under the control of a heat-shock promoter, suggesting that whether an mRNA undergoes quality control is encrypted therein. Under normal conditions, Mex67 adaptor proteins are recruited for RNA surveillance, with only quality-controlled mRNAs allowed to associate with Mex67 and leave the nucleus. Thus, at the cost of error-free mRNA formation, heat-shock mRNAs are exported and translated without delay, allowing cells to survive extreme situations.}},

While we found a striking degree of functional conservation among the examined cis elements, their DNA sequences lacked apparent conservation with the C . elegans orthologs. In fact, sequence similarity between C . elegans and the distantly related nematodes was no greater than would be expected by chance. Short motifs, similar to known regulatory sequences in C . elegans , can be detected in most of the cis elements. When tested, some of these sites appear to mediate regulatory function. However, they seem to have originated through motif turnover, rather than to have been preserved from a common ancestor. Our results suggest that gene regulatory networks are broadly conserved in the phylum Nematoda, but this conservation persists despite substantial reorganization of regulatory elements and could not be detected using naïve comparisons of sequence similarity.}},

Cells read this molecular instruction manual by a process called transcription, in which proteins called transcription factors bind to DNA in specific places and regulate which sections of the DNA will be expressed. These 'transcripts' are active molecules that determine the cell’s – and ultimately the individual’s – characteristics. However, it is not well understood how alterations in the DNA of different individuals or species can lead to changes in where the transcription factors bind, and in which transcripts are expressed. Carvunis, Wang, Skola et al. set out to determine if there is a relationship between how often DNA changes and how often transcription changes during the evolution of animals. The experiments examined the abundance of transcripts in the cells of a variety of animal species with close or distant evolutionary relationships. For example, the house mouse was compared to a close relative called the Algerian mouse, to another species of rodent (rat) and to humans. The experiments show that the changes in transcript abundances are happening at similar rates in mammals, birds and insects, even though DNA changes at very different rates in these groups of animals. This similarity was also observed for other aspects of transcription, such as in changes to where transcription factors bind to DNA. The next challenges are to find out what makes transcription evolve at such similar rates in these groups of animals, and whether these findings extend to other species and to other processes in cells.}},

Here, we present the genome sequence of Paramecium caudatum, a species closely related to the Paramecium aurelia species group. P. caudatum shares only the most ancient of the three WGDs with the aurelia complex. We found that P. caudatum maintains twice as many paralogs from this early event as the P. aurelia species, suggesting that post-WGD gene retention is influenced by subsequent WGDs, and supporting the importance of selection for dosage in gene retention. The availability of P. caudatum as an outgroup allows an expanded analysis of the aurelia intermediate and recent WGD events. Both the GC content and the expression level of pre-duplication genes are significant predictors of duplicate retention. We find widespread asymmetrical evolution among aurelia paralogs, which is likely caused by gradual pseudogenization rather than by neofunctionalization. Finally, cases of divergent resolution of intermediate WGD duplicates between aurelia species implicate this process acts as an on-going reinforcement mechanism of reproductive isolation long after a WGD event.}},

Although polyploidy is recognized as an important component of plant evolution, it is generally considered to play a relatively minor role in animal evolution. Ancient polyploidy is found in the ancestry of some animals, especially fishes, but there is little evidence for ancient WGDs in other metazoan lineages. Here we use recently published transcriptomes and genomes from more than 150 species across the insect phylogeny to investigate whether ancient WGDs occurred during the evolution of Hexapoda, the most diverse clade of animals. Using gene age distributions and phylogenomics, we found evidence for 18 ancient WGDs and six other large-scale bursts of gene duplication during insect evolution. These bursts of gene duplication occurred in the history of lineages such as the Lepidoptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata. To further corroborate the nature of these duplications, we evaluated the pattern of gene retention from putative WGDs observed in the gene age distributions. We found a relatively strong signal of convergent gene retention across many of the putative insect WGDs. Considering the phylogenetic breadth and depth of the insect phylogeny, this observation is consistent with polyploidy as we expect dosage balance to drive the parallel retention of genes. Together with recent research on plant evolution, our hexapod results suggest that genome duplications contributed to the evolution of two of the most diverse lineages of eukaryotes on Earth.}},

Existing approaches to reconstruct tissues assign spatial positions to each cell, independently of other cells, by using spatial patterns of expression of marker genes5,6—which often do not exist. Here we reconstruct spatial positions with little or no prior knowledge, by searching for spatial arrangements of sequenced cells in which nearby cells have transcriptional profiles that are often (but not always) more similar than cells that are farther apart. We formulate this task as a generalized optimal-transport problem for probabilistic embedding and derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve it. We reconstruct the spatial expression of genes in mammalian liver and intestinal epithelium, fly and zebrafish embryos, sections from the mammalian cerebellum and whole kidney, and use the reconstructed tissues to identify genes that are spatially informative. Thus, we identify an organization principle for the spatial expression of genes in animal tissues, which can be exploited to infer meaningful probabilities of spatial position for individual cells. Our framework (‘novoSpaRc’) can incorporate prior spatial information and is compatible with any single-cell technology. Additional principles that underlie the cartography of gene expression can be tested using our approach. A new computational framework, novoSpaRc, leverages single-cell data to reconstruct spatial context for cells and spatial expression across tissues and organisms, on the basis of an organization principle for gene expression.}},

We demonstrate that P2C functions in six mosquito species.

Here, we present PopGenome, a population genomics package for the R software environment (a de facto standard for statistical analyses). PopGenome can efficiently process genome-scale data as well as large sets of individual loci. It reads DNA alignments and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data sets in most common formats, including those used by the HapMap, 1000 human genomes, and 1001 Arabidopsis genomes projects. PopGenome also reads associated annotation files in GFF format, enabling users to easily define regions or classify SNPs based on their annotation; all analyses can also be applied to sliding windows. PopGenome offers a wide range of diverse population genetics analyses, including neutrality tests as well as statistics for population differentiation, linkage disequilibrium, and recombination. PopGenome is linked to Hudson’s MS and Ewing’s MSMS programs to assess statistical significance based on coalescent simulations. PopGenome’s integration in R facilitates effortless and reproducible downstream analyses as well as the production of publication-quality graphics. Developers can easily incorporate new analyses methods into the PopGenome framework.

With the acceleration of recent genome-wide studies of regulated transcription, it has become clear that transcriptional enhancers in mammalian genomes are major sources of pervasive non-coding RNA transcription. In this review, we begin with the definition of promoters and enhancers as DNA regulatory elements and focus on transcriptional enhancers in mammalian genomes. We discuss functional roles of enhancer transcription and several hypothetical mechanisms in terms of enhancer-promoter communication. We also summarize the emerging roles of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in early elongation, such that eRNA transcript, independent from enhancer transcription, may facilitate NELF release from paused RNAPII by acting as a lure molecule. In particular, transcriptional enhancers might modulate the release of paused RNAPII via 3D chromatin looping. Emerging evidence suggests that transcriptional enhancers may play regulatory roles in promoter-proximal pausing of RNAPII, a key rate-limiting step for productive elongation.}},

How female Nasonia control the developmental trajectory of their offspring is unclear. Here, we took advantage of the recent discovery that DNA methylation is pervasive in Nasonia and tested its role in photoperiodism. We used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to profile DNA methylation in adult female wasps subjected to different photoperiods and identified substantial differential methylation at the single base level. We also show that knocking down DNA methyltransferase 1a (Dnmt1a), Dnmt3, or blocking DNA methylation pharmacologically, largely disrupts the photoperiodic diapause response of the wasps.

Conserved CRE function is associated with sequence conservation, proximity to coding genes, cell type specificity of CRE function, and transcription factor binding.

Transposable elements (TEs) are the primary source of novelty in primate gene regulation. Newly evolved CREs are enriched in young TEs that affect gene expression.

  title = {{Large-scale analysis of Drosophila core promoter function using synthetic promoters}}, 
  author = {Qi, Z}, 
  abstract = {{The core promoter comprises the transcription start site (TSS) and approximately 150 bp of the flanking sequence. The accurate transcription initiation and basal expression level of a gene are primarily determined by differential recruitment of the transcription machinery, which is also known as the pre-initiation complex (PIC) consisting of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) together with the general transcription factors (GTFs), to its core promoter region.
Genome-wide studies have revealed various properties of native core promoters, including a crucial sequence feature called sequence motifs which enrich as over-represented DNA sequences that mark the potential binding sites of GTFs. Correlating these motifs to gene sets with distinct expression features allowed the fine-grained classification of core promoter into regulated/stalled, highly regulated, housekeeping and ribosomal architectures, which also showed different chromatin properties. Genetic variations naturally occurred at the motif sites were recently proved to alter both promoter strength and TSS distribution significantly. Despite the enormous importance of the core promoter and its sequence features, how they encode or compute the intrinsic expression levels remains poorly understood. The systematic mutational approach which perturbs native sequences and measures consequent effects is a powerful tool to ascertain the functional influence of specific features on promoter activity. In this thesis, I report on a large- scale luciferase-assay-based method developed to quantitatively measure promoter activity with high reproducibility and sensitivity in the well-studied experimental model Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster). We applied this technique to measure both basal and induced expressions of systematically designed promoters in D. melanogaster, decoding the sequence determinants of their activity.
The synthetic promoter constructs consist of: (1) a motif-rich core promoter region of 130 bp around TSS from our designed library with thousands of native and perturbative sequences representing different core promoter architectures; (2) a stimulus-response element for binding of the ecdysone receptors to recruit the steroid hormone ecdysone for transcriptional activation; and (3) the genomic -1 and +1 nucleosome positioning sequences to mimic the endogenous nucleosomal context. A high-throughput experimental pipeline using automated robot systems was implemented and optimized for reporter plasmids isolation, Drosophila S2 cell transient transfection, ecdysone treatment and dual luciferase assay, which enabled highly reproducible
XI
measurements of promoter activity. The entire measurements of all tested synthetic promoters covered a wide range over more than four orders of magnitude in activity level.
By extensively testing mutagenized core promoter sequences, we corroborated the functional specificity of sequence motifs and that their adequate strength (PWM score) and precise positioning are essential features of core promoter activity. Additionally, our highly sensitive measurements of single base pair mutations could be used to produce the expression-based position probability matrices (PPMs) and activity logos for core promoter motifs. The context sequences surrounding the motifs also played a role but usually less prominent in defining the activity.
Moreover, combinatorial motif mutations that altered both the strength and the positioning of all motifs often resulted in strong effects, which were then compared with the effects of individual motif mutations. Remarkably, we found a linear combination of these individual motif features could largely (\textbackslashtextasciitilde 77\%) account for the combinatorial effects on core promoter activity. When applying a similar analysis to the combination of sequence feature blocks containing motifs together with their flanking and context sequences, 66\% of the variance in expression levels could be linearly explained.
Finally, we showed that the surrounding sequences of the core promoter region also influenced promoter activity, especially for the ecdysone response element (EcRE). The ecdysone responsiveness correlated with the core promoter architecture, that is, ecdysone could induce both developmental and constitutive core promoters but the induction was stronger with the developmental ones. We also found a negative correlation between the ecdysone inducibility and the basal expression level; this correlation was more significant for constitutive promoters. Finally, by testing the nucleosomal context sequences, we found that the TSS downstream nucleosome positioning sequence had a stronger influence on constitutive core promoter activity.
Overall, this large-scale quantitative core promoter activity analysis enabled the first comprehensive dissection of Drosophila core promoter features and shed light on their roles for better predictability of gene expression.}},

By examining transcriptional activation of a reporter by the endogenous even-skipped enhancers, which are located 150 kb away, we identify three distinct topological conformation states and measure their transition kinetics. We show that sustained proximity of the enhancer to its target is required for activation.

Furthermore, the facilitated long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the locus, causing corresponding developmental defects.

Recent studies have revealed that enhancers are bi-directionally transcribed into enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Using single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH), we investigated the eRNA-mediated regulation of transcription during estrogen induction in MCF-7 cells. We demonstrate that eRNAs are localized exclusively in the nucleus and are induced with similar kinetics as target mRNAs. However, eRNAs are mostly nascent at enhancers and their steady-state levels remain lower than those of their cognate mRNAs. Surprisingly, at the single-allele level, eRNAs are rarely co-expressed with their target loci, demonstrating that active gene transcription does not require the continuous transcription of eRNAs or their accumulation at enhancers. When co-expressed, sub-diffraction distance measurements between nascent mRNA and eRNA signals reveal that co-transcription of eRNAs and mRNAs rarely occurs within closed enhancer-promoter loops. Lastly, basal eRNA transcription at enhancers, but not E2-induced transcription, is maintained upon depletion of MLL1 and ERα, suggesting some degree of chromatin accessibility prior to signal-dependent activation of transcription. Together, our findings suggest that eRNA accumulation at enhancer-promoter loops is not required to sustain target gene transcription.}},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Core promoters are the gene regulatory regions most proximal to the transcription start site (TSS), central to the formation of pre-initiation complexes and for combinatorial gene regulation. The DNA elements required for core promoter function in plants are poorly understood. To establish the sequence motifs that characterize plant core promoters and to compare them to the corresponding sequences in animals, we took advantage of available full-length cDNAs (FL-cDNAs) and predicted upstream regulatory sequences to carry out the analysis of 12,749 Arabidopsis core promoters.

RESULTS:Using a combination of expectation maximization and Gibbs sampling methods, we identified several motifs overrepresented in Arabidopsis core promoters. One of them corresponded to the TATA element, for which an in-depth analysis resulted in the generation of robust TATA Nucleotide Frequency Matrices (NFMs) capable of predicting Arabidopsis TATA elements with a high degree of confidence. We established that approximately 29\% of all Arabidopsis promoters contain TATA motifs, clustered around position -32 with respect to the TSS. The presence of TATA elements was associated with genes represented more frequently in EST collections and with shorter 5' UTRs. No cis-elements were found over-represented in TATA-less, compared to TATA-containing promoters.

CONCLUSION:Our studies provide a first genome-wide illustration of the composition and structure of core Arabidopsis promoters. The percentage of TATA-containing promoters is much lower than commonly recognized, yet comparable to the number of Drosophila promoters containing a TATA element. Although several other DNA elements were identified as over-represented in Arabidopsis promoters, they are present in only a small fraction of the genes and they represent elements not previously described in animals, suggesting a distinct architecture of the core promoters of plant and animal genes.}},

  abstract = {{Eukaryotic promoter regions are frequently divergently transcribed in vivo, but it is unknown whether the resultant antisense RNAs are a mechanistic by-product of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription or biologically meaningful. Here, we use a functional evolutionary approach that involves nascent transcript mapping in S. cerevisiae strains containing foreign yeast DNA. Promoter regions in foreign environments lose the directionality they have in their native species. Strikingly, fortuitous promoter regions arising in foreign DNA produce equal transcription in both directions, indicating that divergent transcription is a mechanistic feature that does not imply a function for these transcripts. Fortuitous promoter regions arising during evolution promote bidirectional transcription and over time are purged through mutation or retained to enable new functionality. Similarly, human transcription is more bidirectional at newly evolved enhancers and promoter regions. Thus, promoter regions are intrinsically bidirectional and are shaped by evolution to bias transcription toward coding versus non-coding RNAs.}},

Utilizing a probabilistic sequence model, we ascertain that only approximately 19\% of rice genes possess the TATA box, but approximately 50\% contain one or more Y Patches in their core promoters.

The result is up to 14 hRFC transcripts for which different 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) are fused to a common coding sequence. By in vitro translation assays with hRFC constructs corresponding to the major transcript forms, most of the forms were translated poorly. Upon expression of the 5'UTR-hRFC constructs in hRFC-null HeLa cells, a range of steady state hRFC proteins and transcripts were detected that reflected relative transcript stabilities and, to a lesser extent, translation efficiencies. Transcripts including 5' UTRs derived from non-coding exon A encoded a modified hRFC protein translated from an upstream initiation site. When this modified hRFC protein was expressed in hRFC-null K562 cells, there were only minor differences in surface targeting, stability, or transport function from wild type hRFC.

Notably, we provide transcriptome-wide evidence that enhancers control burst frequencies, and demonstrate that cell-type-specific gene expression is primarily shaped by changes in burst frequencies. Together, our data show that burst frequency is primarily encoded in enhancers and burst size in core promoters, and that allelic single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful model for investigating transcriptional kinetics.}},

  doi = {10.1101/839944}, 
  abstract = {{When interpreting sequencing data from multiple spatial or longitudinal biopsies, detecting sample mix-ups is essential yet more difficult than in studies of germline variation. In most genomic studies of tumors, genetic variation is frequently detected through pairwise comparisons of the tumor and a matched normal tissue from the sample donor, and in many cases, only somatic variants are reported. The disjoint genotype information that results hinders the use of existing tools that detect sample swaps solely based on genotypes of germline variants. To address this problem, we have developed somalier , which can operate directly on the alignments, so as not to require jointly-called germline variants. Instead, somalier extracts a small sketch of informative genetic variation for each sample. Sketches from hundreds of biopsies and normal tissues can then be compared in under a second. This speed also makes it useful for checking relatedness in large cohorts of germline samples. Somalier produces both text output and an interactive visual report that facilitates the detection and correction of sample swaps using multiple relatedness metrics. We introduce the tool and demonstrate its utility on a cohort of five glioma samples each with a normal, tumor, and cell-free DNA sample. Applying somalier to high-coverage sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project also identifies several related samples. Somalier can be applied to diverse sequencing data types and genome builds, and is freely available for academic use at [github.com/brentp/somalier][1]. [1]: http://github.com/brentp/somalier}},

In zebrafish, DNA methylation patterns are programmed in transcriptionally quiescent cleavage embryos; paternally inherited patterns are maintained, whereas maternal patterns are reprogrammed to match the paternal. Here, we provide the mechanism by demonstrating that "Placeholder" nucleosomes, containing histone H2A variant H2A.Z(FV) and H3K4me1, virtually occupy all regions lacking DNA methylation in both sperm and cleavage embryos and reside at promoters encoding housekeeping and early embryonic transcription factors. Upon genome-wide transcriptional onset, genes with Placeholder become either active (H3K4me3) or silent (H3K4me3/K27me3). Notably, perturbations causing Placeholder loss confer DNA methylation accumulation, whereas acquisition/expansion of Placeholder confers DNA hypomethylation and improper gene activation. Thus, during transcriptionally quiescent gametic and embryonic stages, an H2A.Z(FV)/H3K4me1-containing Placeholder nucleosome deters DNA methylation, poising parental genes for either gene-specific activation or facultative repression.</p>}},

Through genome sequencing, we resolved eight large nested inversions, smaller inversions, duplications and thousands of deletions. These extensive rearrangements caused many changes to chromatin topology, disrupting long-range loops, topologically associating domains (TADs) and promoter interactions, yet these are not predictive of changes in expression. Gene expression is generally not altered around inversion breakpoints, indicating that mis-appropriate enhancer–promoter activation is a rare event. Similarly, shuffling or fusing TADs, changing intra-TAD connections and disrupting long-range inter-TAD loops does not alter expression for the majority of genes. Our results suggest that properties other than chromatin topology ensure productive enhancer–promoter interactions. Systematic analysis of highly rearranged balancer chromosomes in Drosophila shows that extensive changes to chromatin topology affect the expression of only a subset of genes.}},

In T47D cells, we identified more than 200 HCRs, which are frequently bound by unliganded ESR1 and PGR. These HCRs establish steady long-distance inter-TAD interactions between them and organize characteristic looping structures with promoters in their TADs even in the absence of hormones in ESR1+-PGR+cells. This organization is dependent on the expression of the receptors and is further dynamically modulated in response to steroid hormones. HCRs function as platforms that integrate different signals, resulting in some cases in opposite transcriptional responses to estrogens or progestins. Altogether, these results suggest that steroid hormone receptors act not only as hormone-regulated sequence-specific transcription factors but also as local and global genome organizers.}},

We use synthetic networks with predictable cellular trajectories as well as curated Boolean models to serve as the ground truth for evaluating the accuracy of GRN inference algorithms. We develop a strategy to simulate single-cell gene expression data from these two types of networks that avoids the pitfalls of previously-used methods. We selected 12 representative GRN inference algorithms. We found that the accuracy of these methods (measured in terms of AUROC and AUPRC) was moderate, by and large, although the methods were better in recovering interactions in the synthetic networks than the Boolean models. Techniques that did not require pseudotime-ordered cells were more accurate, in general. The observation that the endpoints of many false positive edges were connected by paths of length two in the Boolean models suggested that indirect effects may be predominant in the outputs of the algorithms we tested. The predicted networks were considerably inconsistent with each other, indicating that combining GRN inference algorithms using ensembles is likely to be challenging. Based on the results, we present some recommendations to users of GRN inference algorithms, including suggestions on how to create simulated gene expression datasets for testing them.

We combined a highly synchronous photobioreactor culture system with frequent temporal sampling to characterize genome-wide diurnal gene expression in Chlamydomonas. Over 80\% of the measured transcriptome was expressed with strong periodicity, forming 18 major clusters. Genes associated with complex structures and processes, including cell cycle control, flagella and basal bodies, ribosome biogenesis, and energy metabolism, all had distinct signatures of coexpression with strong predictive value for assigning and temporally ordering function. Importantly, the frequent sampling regime allowed us to discern meaningful fine-scale phase differences between and within subgroups of genes and enabled the identification of a transiently expressed cluster of light stress genes. Coexpression was further used both as a data-mining tool to classify and/or validate genes from other data sets related to the cell cycle and to flagella and basal bodies and to assign isoforms of duplicated enzymes to their cognate pathways of central carbon metabolism. Our diurnal coexpression data capture functional relationships established by dozens of prior studies and are a valuable new resource for investigating a variety of biological processes in Chlamydomonas and other eukaryotes.}},

However, how these multiple genes are orchestrated at the systems level to attain the natural variation in size including sexual size dimorphism is mostly unknown. Here we take a multi‐layered systems omics approach to study size variation in the Drosophila wing. We show that expression levels of many critical growth regulators such as Wnt and TGFβ pathway components significantly differ between sexes but not between lines exhibiting size differences within each sex, suggesting a primary role of these regulators in sexual size dimorphism. Only a few growth genes including a receptor of steroid hormone ecdysone exhibit association with between‐line size differences. In contrast, we find that between‐line size variation is largely regulated by genes with a diverse range of cellular functions, most of which have never been implicated in growth. In addition, we show that expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) linked to these novel growth regulators accurately predict population‐wide, between‐line wing size variation. In summary, our study unveils differential gene regulatory systems that control wing size variation between and within sexes. The study investigates transcriptomic variation that reflects a natural genetic diversity in fly wings. Through a multi‐layered systems omics approach, regulatory systems that control two distinct aspects of wing size variation are determined. Size variation between sexes (sexual size dimorphism) is mainly regulated by previously established, canonical growth genes and pathways. Size variation within each sex is mostly controlled by novel growth genes with a variety of cellular functions. A subset of SNPs linked to the expression of several novel growth genes named “mediators” accurately predicts the population‐wide size variation within each sex. The study investigates transcriptomic variation that reflects a natural genetic diversity in fly wings.

The relative positions of each of the factors in the complexes were determined by DNAase I footprint analysis. TFIIA, derived from yeast or mammalian cells, formed a complex with yeast TFIID and the TATA element. TFIIB bound to this complex and probably acts as a "bridge" to the polymerase and the initiation site. The addition of ATP or dATP, necessary for "activation" of transcription, resulted in an alteration of the footprint in the +20 to +30 region, the same area protected upon addition of TFIIE to the initiation complex. Addition of ribonucleotide triphosphates generated new complexes that contained accurately initiated transcripts associated with the transcription machinery and the template DNA.

Most assembly transitions can be classified into three basic types, which can then be used to exhaustively enumerate a large set of possible quaternary structure topologies.

We observed that differentially methylated sites (DMSs) generally show decreased methylation during granulopoiesis. Methylation appears to change at specific differentiation stages and overlap with changes in transcription and activity of key hematopoietic transcription factors. DMSs were preferentially located in areas distal to CpG islands and shores. Also, DMSs were overrepresented in enhancer elements and enriched in enhancers that become active during differentiation. Overall, this study depicts in detail the epigenetic and transcriptional changes that occur during granulopoiesis and supports the role of DNA methylation as a regulatory mechanism in blood cell differentiation.}},

Here we describe a single-cell multi-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during the onset of gastrulation in mouse embryos. The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the establishment of a global repressive epigenetic landscape, followed by the emergence of lineage-specific epigenetic patterns during gastrulation. Notably, cells committed to mesoderm and endoderm undergo widespread coordinated epigenetic rearrangements at enhancer marks, driven by ten-eleven translocation (TET)-mediated demethylation and a concomitant increase of accessibility. By contrast, the methylation and accessibility landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early epiblast. Hence, regulatory elements associated with each germ layer are either epigenetically primed or remodelled before cell-fate decisions, providing the molecular framework for a hierarchical emergence of the primary germ layers. Single-cell mapping of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during gastrulation in mouse embryos shows characteristic epigenetic changes that accompany formation of the primary germ layers.}},

Pancreatic progenitor tumours preferentially express genes involved in early pancreatic development (FOXA2/3, PDX1 and MNX1). ADEX tumours displayed upregulation of genes that regulate networks involved in KRAS activation, exocrine (NR5A2 and RBPJL), and endocrine differentiation (NEUROD1 and NKX2-2).

We prioritized causal variants within disease- or trait-associated loci from all publicly available genome-wide association studies and experimentally validated predictions for four immune-related diseases. By exploiting the scalability of ExPecto, we characterized the regulatory mutation space for human RNA polymerase II–transcribed genes by in silico saturation mutagenesis and profiled > 140 million promoter-proximal mutations. This enables probing of evolutionary constraints on gene expression and ab initio prediction of mutation disease effects, making ExPecto an end-to-end computational framework for the in silico prediction of expression and disease risk. ExPecto is a deep learning–based framework that can predict the tissue-specific transcriptional effects of mutations on the basis of DNA sequence alone.

A possible mechanism is suggested by the observation that the shape of the DNA helix within the TFBM can be affected by mutation of flanking bases that modulate transcription factor affinity. Strikingly, dormant genomic clusters of ETS and GATA sites are awakened by most instances of spacer randomization, suggesting that the sequence of naturally-occurring spacers ensures the dormancy of a majority of the large reservoir of TFBM clusters present in a metazoan genome.}},

To this end, we profiled TSSs activity genome-wide in S. pombe cultures exposed to heat shock, nitrogen starvation, peroxide and two commonly applied media, YES and EMM2, using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE).

Thus, Identifying active cis-regulatory regions in the human genome is critical for understanding gene regulation and assessing the impact of genetic variation on phenotype. The developments of high-throughput sequencing and machine learning technologies make it possible to predict cis-regulatory regions genome wide. Based on rich data resources such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM) projects, we introduce DECRES based on supervised deep learning approaches for the identification of enhancer and promoter regions in the human genome. Due to their ability to discover patterns in large and complex data, the introduction of deep learning methods enables a significant advance in our knowledge of the genomic locations of cis-regulatory regions. Using models for well-characterized cell lines, we identify key experimental features that contribute to the predictive performance. Applying DECRES, we delineate locations of 300,000 candidate enhancers genome wide (6.8\% of the genome, of which 40,000 are supported by bidirectional transcription data), and 26,000 candidate promoters (0.6\% of the genome). The predicted annotations of cis-regulatory regions will provide broad utility for genome interpretation from functional genomics to clinical applications. The DECRES model demonstrates potentials of deep learning technologies when combined with high-throughput sequencing data, and inspires the development of other advanced neural network models for further improvement of genome annotations.}},

Here, we use a recent comprehensive data set of DNase I sequencing-identified cis-regulatory binding sites (footprints) at single-base-pair resolution to compare binding sites and network connectivity in duplicated gene pairs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We found that duplicated gene pairs vary greatly in their cis-regulatory element architecture, resulting in changes in regulatory network connectivity. Whole-genome duplicates (WGDs) have approximately twice as many footprints in their promoters left by potential regulatory proteins than do tandem duplicates (TDs). The WGDs have a greater average number of footprint differences between paralogs than TDs. The footprints, in turn, result in more regulatory network connections between WGDs and other genes, forming denser, more complex regulatory networks than shown by TDs. When comparing regulatory connections between duplicates, WGDs had more pairs in which the two genes are either partially or fully diverged in their network connections, but fewer genes with no network connections than the TDs. There is evidence of younger TDs and WGDs having fewer unique connections compared with older duplicates.

These controversies are due in part to complex patterns of phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic signal coming from regions of the genome experiencing distinct evolutionary forces, which can be difficult to disentangle. Here we profile the amounts and proportions of phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic signal derived from loci spread across mammalian genomes. We identified orthologous sequences from primates, rodents, and pecora, annotated sites as one or more of nine locus types (e.g. coding, intronic, intergenic), and profiled the phylogenetic information contained within locus types across evolutionary timescales associated with each clade. In all cases, non-coding loci provided more overall signal and a higher proportion of phylogenetic signal compared to coding loci. This suggests potential benefits if perspectives are altered away from primarily targeting genes or coding regions for phylogenetic studies, particularly in this era of accessible whole genome sequence data. In contrast to long-held assumptions about the phylogenetic utility of more variable genomic regions, most locus types provided relatively consistent phylogenetic information across timescales, although we find evidence that coding and intronic regions may, respectively and to a limited degree, inform disproportionately about older and younger splits. As part of this work we also validate the SISRS pipeline as an annotation-free ortholog discovery pipeline capable of identifying millions of phylogenetically informative sites directly from raw sequencing reads.</p>}},

  doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/bth058}, 
  abstract = {{MOTIVATION:Accurate gene structure annotation is a challenging computational problem in genomics. The best results are achieved with spliced alignment of full-length cDNAs or multiple expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with sufficient overlap to cover the entire gene. For most species, cDNA and EST collections are far from comprehensive. We sought to overcome this bottleneck by exploring the possibility of using combined EST resources from fairly diverged species that still share a common gene space. Previous spliced alignment tools were found inadequate for this task because they rely on very high sequence similarity between the ESTs and the genomic DNA.

RESULTS:We have developed a computer program, GeneSeqer, which is capable of aligning thousands of ESTs with a long genomic sequence in a reasonable amount of time. The algorithm is uniquely designed to tolerate a high percentage of mismatches and insertions or deletions in the EST relative to the genomic template. This feature allows use of non-cognate ESTs for gene structure prediction, including ESTs derived from duplicated genes and homologous genes from related species. The increased gene prediction sensitivity results in part from novel splice site prediction models that are also available as a stand-alone splice site prediction tool. We assessed GeneSeqer performance relative to a standard Arabidopsis thaliana gene set and demonstrate its utility for plant genome annotation. In particular, we propose that this method provides a timely tool for the annotation of the rice genome, using abundant ESTs from other cereals and plants.

  doi = {10.1101/gr.210930.116}, 
  abstract = {{Transcriptional enhancers are critical for maintaining cell type-specific gene expression and driving cell fate changes during development. Highly transcribed genes are often associated with a cluster of individual enhancers such as those found in locus control regions. Recently these have been termed stretch enhancers or super-enhancers, which have been predicted to regulate critical cell identity genes. We employed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion approach to study the function of several enhancer clusters (ECs) and isolated enhancers in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Our results reveal that the effect of deleting ECs, also classified as ES cell super-enhancers, is highly variable, resulting in target gene expression reductions ranging from 12\% to as much as 92\%. Partial deletions of these ECs which removed only one enhancer or a sub-cluster of enhancers revealed partially redundant control of the regulated gene by multiple enhancers within the larger cluster. Many highly transcribed genes in ES cells are not associated with a super-enhancer; furthermore, super-enhancer predictions ignore 81\% of the potentially active regulatory elements predicted by co-binding of 5 or more pluripotency-associated transcription factors. Deletion of these additional enhancer regions revealed their robust regulatory role in gene transcription. In addition, select super-enhancers and enhancers were identified which regulated clusters of paralogous genes. We conclude that whereas robust transcriptional output can be achieved by an isolated enhancer, clusters of enhancers acting on a common target gene act in a partially redundant manner to fine tune transcriptional output of their target genes.}},

Some integron GCs, called ORF-less GCs, contain no identifiable ORF with a small number shown to be involved in antisense mRNA mediated gene regulation. In this study, the promoter activity of ORF-less GCs, previously recovered from the oral metagenome, was verified by cloning them upstream of a gusA reporter, proving they can function as a promoter, presumably allowing bacteria to adapt to multiple stresses within the complex physico-chemical environment of the human oral cavity. A bi-directional promoter detection system was also developed allowing direct identification of clones with promoter-containing GCs on agar plates. Novel promoter-containing GCs were identified from the human oral metagenomic DNA using this construct, called pBiDiPD. This is the first demonstration and detection of promoter activity of ORF-less GCs from Treponema bacteria and the development of an agar plate-based detection system will enable similar studies in other environments.}},

Here we identify N(6)-methyladenine as another form of DNA modification in mouse embryonic stem cells. Alkbh1 encodes a demethylase for N(6)-methyladenine. An increase of N(6)-methyladenine levels in Alkbh1-deficient cells leads to transcriptional silencing. N(6)-methyladenine deposition is inversely correlated with the evolutionary age of LINE-1 transposons; its deposition is strongly enriched at young (<1.5 million years old) but not old (>6 million years old) L1 elements. The deposition of N(6)-methyladenine correlates with epigenetic silencing of such LINE-1 transposons, together with their neighbouring enhancers and genes, thereby resisting the gene activation signals during embryonic stem cell differentiation. As young full-length LINE-1 transposons are strongly enriched on the X chromosome, genes located on the X chromosome are also silenced. Thus, N(6)-methyladenine developed a new role in epigenetic silencing in mammalian evolution distinct from its role in gene activation in other organisms. Our results demonstrate that N(6)-methyladenine constitutes a crucial component of the epigenetic regulation repertoire in mammalian genomes.}},

Novel TSS consistent with non-Pol-II transcripts can be found in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. By identifying TSS derived from all RNA-polymerases, ReCappable-seq reveals distinct epigenetic marks among Pol-lI and non-Pol-II TSS and provides a unique opportunity to concurrently interrogate the regulatory landscape of coding and non-coding RNA.}},

Previous studies have explored the presence of genomic features, such as CpG islands and sequence motifs, in these promoter classes, but virtually no studies have directly investigated the relationship with chromatin features. Here, we show that promoter classes are significantly differentiated by nucleosome organization and chromatin structure. Dispersed promoters display higher associations with well-positioned nucleosomes downstream of the TSS and a more clearly defined nucleosome free region upstream, while focused promoters have a less organized nucleosome structure, yet higher presence of RNA polymerase II. These differences extend to histone variants (H2A.Z) and marks (H3K4 methylation), as well as insulator binding (such as CTCF), independent of the expression levels of affected genes. Notably, differences are conserved across mammals and flies, and they provide for a clearer separation of promoter architectures than the presence and absence of CpG islands or the occurrence of stalled RNA polymerase. Computational models support the stronger contribution of chromatin features to the definition of dispersed promoters compared to focused start sites. Our results show that promoter classes defined from 5′ capped transcripts not only reflect differences in the initiation process at the core promoter but also are indicative of divergent transcriptional programs established within gene-proximal nucleosome organization.}},

In order to understand how these cascades function, they can be dissected into small genetic networks, each containing just a few Pol II transcribed genes, that generate specific signal-processing outcomes. Small RNA regulatory circuits involve direct regulation of a small RNA by a TF and/or direct regulation of a TF by a small RNA and have been shown to play unique roles in many organisms. Here, we will focus on small RNA regulatory circuits containing Pol II transcribed microRNAs (miRNAs). While the role of miRNA-containing regulatory circuits as modular building blocks for the function of complex networks has long been on the forefront of studies in the animal kingdom, plant studies are poised to take a lead role in this area because of their advantages in probing transcriptional and posttranscriptional control of Pol II genes. The relative simplicity of tissue- and cell-type organization, miRNA targeting, and genomic structure make the Arabidopsis thaliana plant model uniquely amenable for small RNA regulatory circuit studies in a multicellular organism. In this Review, we cover analysis, tools, and validation methods for probing the component interactions in miRNA-containing regulatory circuits. We then review the important roles that plant miRNAs are playing in these circuits and summarize methods for the identification of small genetic circuits that strongly influence plant function. We conclude by noting areas of opportunity where new plant studies are imminently needed.}},

It is essential, therefore, to understand the evolutionary advantage of an allele that confers cells the ability to express a range of phenotypes. Of particular importance is to understand how this advantage of phenotypic plasticity depends on the degree of heritability of non-genetically encoded phenotypes between generations, which can induce irreversible evolutionary changes in the population. Here, we study the fate of a new mutation that allows the expression of multiple phenotypic states, introduced into a finite population otherwise composed of individuals who can express only a single phenotype. We analyze the fixation probability of such an allele as a function of the strength of inter-generational phenotypic heritability, called memory, the variance of expressible phenotypes, the rate of environmental changes, and the population size. We find that the fate of a phenotypically plastic allele depends fundamentally on the environmental regime. In a constant environment, the fixation probability of a plastic allele always increases with the degree of phenotypic memory. In periodically fluctuating environments, by contrast, there is an optimum phenotypic memory that maximizes the probability of the plastic allele's fixation. This same optimum value of phenotypic memory also maximizes geometric mean fitness, in steady state. We interpret these results in the context of previous studies in an infinite-population framework. We also discuss the implications of our results for the design of therapies that can overcome resistance, in a variety of diseases.}},

Kimura's (J. Mol.

This approach, therefore, also minimizes stochastic errors. Computer simulations indicate that the method presented gives more accurate Ks and Ka estimates than the aforementioned methods.

We present a probabilistic method for identifying orthologs that considers all possible orthology/paralogy assignments for a set of genomes with a shared WGD (here five yeast species). This approach allows us to estimate how confident we can be in the orthology assignments in each genomic region. Two inferences produced by this model are indicative of purifying selection acting to prevent duplicate gene loss. First, our model suggests that there are significant differences (up to a factor of seven) in duplicate gene half-life. Second, we observe differences between the genes that the model infers to have been lost soon after WGD and those lost more recently. Gene losses soon after WGD appear uncorrelated with gene expression level and knockout fitness defect. However, later losses are biased toward genes whose paralogs have high expression and large knockout fitness defects, as well as showing biases toward certain functional groups such as ribosomal proteins. We suggest that while duplicate copies of some genes may be lost neutrally after WGD, another set of genes may be initially preserved in duplicate by natural selection for reasons including dosage.}},

We use a systems approach to describe the transcriptional landscape of the host response to IAV contrasted with bacterial lipopolysaccharide treated MDMs, observing a failure of IAV-treated MDMs to induce feedback inhibitors of inflammation. Systematic comparison of host RNA sequences incorporated into viral mRNA (“snatched”) against a complete survey of background RNA in the host cell enables an unbiased quantification of over-represented features of snatched host RNAs. We detect preferential snatching of RNAs associated with snRNA transcription and demonstrate that cap-snatching avoids transcripts encoding host ribosomal proteins, which are required by IAV for replication. ![Figure][1] Graphical Abstract (A) Overview of bioinformatics pipeline.

We investigated footprints of whole-genome duplication (WGD) in barley that shaped the cereal ancestor genome by analyzing shared synteny with rice using a \textbackslashtextasciitilde2000 gene-based barley genetic map and the rice genome reference sequence. Based on a recent annotation of the rice genome, we reviewed the WGD in rice and identified 24 pairs of duplicated genomic segments involving 70\% of the rice genome. Using 968 putative orthologous gene pairs, synteny covered 89\% of the barley genetic map and 63\% of the rice genome. We found strong evidence for seven shared segmental genome duplications, corresponding to more than 50\% of the segmental genome duplications previously determined in rice. Analysis of synonymous substitution rates (Ks) suggested that shared duplications originated before the divergence of these two species. While major genome rearrangements affected the ancestral genome of both species, small paracentric inversions were found to be species specific. We provide a thorough analysis of comparative genome evolution between barley and rice. A barley genetic map of approximately 2000 non-redundant EST sequences provided sufficient density to allow a detailed view of shared synteny with the rice genome. Using an indirect approach that included the localization of WGD-derived duplicated genome segments in the rice genome, we determined the current extent of shared WGD-derived genome duplications that occurred prior to species divergence.}},

The updated version is a huge expansion of the first version, which only contains the enhancers in human cells. In addition, we predicted enhancer–target gene relationships in human, mouse and fly. Finally, the users can search enhancers and enhancer–target gene relationships through five user-friendly, interactive modules.

Clustered elements at super enhancers uniquely require 7SK to prevent convergent transcription and DNA-damage signaling. 7SK physically interacts with the BAF chromatin-remodeling complex, recruits BAF to enhancers and inhibits enhancer transcription by modulating chromatin structure. In turn, 7SK occupancy at enhancers coincides with that of Brd4 and is exquisitely sensitive to the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. Thus, 7SK uses distinct mechanisms to counteract the diverse consequences of pervasive transcription that distinguish super enhancers, enhancers and promoters.}},

This modular code opens the possibility to identify virulence targets of natural TAL effectors in host plants including valuable crops. Knowing these targets deepens our understanding of the role of TAL effectors in virulence. At the same time, it is an opportunity to create resistant plants by destroying TAL effector target sites, indispensable for the pathogen, in plant genomes. However, computational methods are needed to effectively scan full genomes or promoteromes for putative target sites. Hence, we propose TALgetter, a new approach for predicting TAL effector target sites. Using TALgetter, we predict target sites of Xanthomonas TAL effectors in the important crop plants rice and sweet orange. Besides novel putative virulence targets of several TAL effectors, we also gain new insights into the biology of TAL effector targeting. The predictions of TALgetter reveal that target sites are preferentially located in the vicinity of the transcription start and that many TAL effectors bind to the TATA-box in the promoters of target genes.}},

Here, I review the origin and evolution of new genes and their functions in eukaryotes, an area of research that has made rapid progress in the past decade thanks to the genomics revolution. Indeed, recent work has provided initial whole-genome views of the different types of new genes for a large number of different organisms. The array of mechanisms underlying the origin of new genes is compelling, extending way beyond the traditionally well-studied source of gene duplication. Thus, it was shown that novel genes also regularly arose from messenger RNAs of ancestral genes, protein-coding genes metamorphosed into new RNA genes, genomic parasites were co-opted as new genes, and that both protein and RNA genes were composed from scratch (i.e., from previously nonfunctional sequences). These mechanisms then also contributed to the formation of numerous novel chimeric gene structures. Detailed functional investigations uncovered different evolutionary pathways that led to the emergence of novel functions from these newly minted sequences and, with respect to animals, attributed a potentially important role to one specific tissue—the testis—in the process of gene birth. Remarkably, these studies also demonstrated that novel genes of the various types significantly impacted the evolution of cellular, physiological, morphological, behavioral, and reproductive phenotypic traits. Consequently, it is now firmly established that new genes have indeed been major contributors to the origin of adaptive evolutionary novelties.}},

  abstract = {{Abstract Topologically associating domains, or TADs, are functional units that organize chromosomes into 3D structures of interacting chromatin. TADs play an important role in regulating gene expression by constraining enhancer-promoter contacts; there is evidence that deletion of TAD boundaries leads to aberrant expression of neighboring genes. While the mechanisms of TAD formation have been well-studied, current knowledge on the extent of TAD conservation across species is inconclusive. Due to the integral role TADs play in gene regulation, their structure and organization is expected to be conserved during evolution. However, more recent research suggests that TAD structures diverge relatively rapidly. We use Hi-C chromosome conformation capture to measure evolutionary conservation of whole TADs and TAD boundary elements between D. melanogaster and D. triauraria , two early-branching species from the melanogaster species group which diverged \textbackslashtextasciitilde15 million years ago. We find that 75\% of TAD boundaries are orthologous while only 25\% of TAD domains are conserved and these are enriched for Polycomb-repressed chromatin. Our results show that TADs have been reorganized since the common ancestor of D. melanogaster and D. triauraria , yet the sequence elements that specify TAD boundaries remain highly conserved. We propose that evolutionary divergence in 3D genome organization results from shuffling of conserved boundary elements across chromosomes, breaking old TADs and creating new TAD architectures. This result supports the existence of distinct TAD subtypes: some may be evolutionarily flexible while others remain highly conserved due to their importance in restricting gene-regulatory element interactions.}},

However, the few models available today have been based on simplistic assumptions about the sequences being modeled, or heuristic approximations of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. We have developed a thermodynamics-based model to predict gene expression driven by any DNA sequence, as a function of transcription factor concentrations and their DNA-binding specificities. It uses statistical thermodynamics theory to model not only protein-DNA interaction, but also the effect of DNA-bound activators and repressors on gene expression. In addition, the model incorporates mechanistic features such as synergistic effect of multiple activators, short range repression, and cooperativity in transcription factor-DNA binding, allowing us to systematically evaluate the significance of these features in the context of available expression data. Using this model on segmentation-related enhancers in Drosophila, we find that transcriptional synergy due to simultaneous action of multiple activators helps explain the data beyond what can be explained by cooperative DNA-binding alone. We find clear support for the phenomenon of short-range repression, where repressors do not directly interact with the basal transcriptional machinery. We also find that the binding sites contributing to an enhancer's function may not be conserved during evolution, and a noticeable fraction of these undergo lineage-specific changes. Our implementation of the model, called GEMSTAT, is the first publicly available program for simultaneously modeling the regulatory activities of a given set of sequences.}},

We find that the same sequences typically encode both enhancer and promoter activities. However, gene promoters generate more promoter activity than distal enhancers, despite generating similar enhancer activity. Surprisingly, the greater promoter activity of gene promoters is not due to conventional core promoter elements or splicing signals. Instead, we find that particular transcription factor binding motifs are intrinsically biased toward the generation of promoter activity, whereas others are not.

The causes of these peculiar patterns are still poorly understood. Within two species (A. thaliana and rice), each representative of one side of the continuum, we studied the consequences of intron presence on coding region and intron G + C content at different scales. By properly taking intron structure into account, we showed that, in both species, intron presence is associated with step changes in nucleotide, codon and amino acid composition. This suggests that introns have a barrier effect structuring G+C content along genes and that previous continuous characterizations of the 5' to 3' gradients were artifactual. In external gene regions (located upstream first or downstream last introns), species-specific factors, such as GC-biased gene conversion, are shaping G+C content while in internal gene regions (surrounded by introns), G + C content is likely constrained to remain within a range common to both species.}},

Although all eQTL studies so far have assayed messenger RNA levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International HapMap Project. By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the HapMap project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that eQTLs near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.}},

Indeed, most alternative exons do not seem to be under selective pressure, suggesting that a large majority of predicted alternative transcripts may not even be translated into proteins.}},

Instead, it has become clear that a huge number of common variants, each with tiny effects, explain most of the heritability. Previously, we argued that these patterns conflict with standard conceptual models, and that new models are needed. Here we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits can be partitioned into direct effects from core genes, and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting as trans-regulators. We argue that the central importance of peripheral genes is a direct consequence of the large contribution of trans-acting variation to gene expression variation. In particular, we propose that if the core genes for a trait are co-regulated - as seems likely - then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified by these co-regulated networks such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by peripheral genes. Thus our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.</p>}},

Potential therapeutic targeting and modulation of Mediator activity in cancers and in fungal infectious diseases emphasizes the importance of studies of Mediator mechanisms for improving human health. The evolutionarily conserved mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription (Mediator) complex is a general regulator of transcription. Recent structural and functional studies have provided important insights into the mechanisms of transcription activation by Mediator and have also revealed a new function of this complex in genome organization and suggested that it could be therapeutically targeted in disease. Alterations in the regulation of gene expression are frequently associated with developmental diseases or cancer. Transcription activation is a key phenomenon in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent functional studies of Mediator with the use of structural biology approaches and functional genomics have revealed new insights into Mediator activity and its regulation during transcription initiation, including how Mediator is recruited to transcription regulatory regions and how it interacts and cooperates with PIC components to assist in PIC assembly. Novel roles of Mediator in the control of gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear space. Clear links between Mediator subunits and disease have also encouraged studies to explore targeting of this complex as a potential therapeutic approach in cancer and fungal infections.}},

However, high-throughput experimental validation of their function and high-resolution dissection of their driver nucleotides remain limited in their scale and length of regions tested. Here, we present a new method, HiDRA (High-Definition Reporter Assay), that overcomes these limitations by combining components of Sharpr-MPRA and STARR-Seq with genome-wide selection of accessible regions from ATAC-Seq. We used HiDRA to test \textbackslashtextasciitilde7 million DNA fragments preferentially selected from accessible chromatin in the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line.

  abstract = {{Mammalian transcriptomes are complex and formed by extensive promoter activity. In addition, gene promoters are largely divergent and initiate transcription of reverse-oriented promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs). Although PROMPTs are commonly terminated early, influenced by polyadenylation sites, promoters often cluster so that the divergent activity of one might impact another. Here, we find that the distance between promoters strongly correlates with the expression, stability and length of their associated PROMPTs. Adjacent promoters driving divergent mRNA transcription support PROMPT formation, but due to polyadenylation site constraints, these transcripts tend to spread into the neighboring mRNA on the same strand. This mechanism to derive new alternative mRNA transcription start sites (TSSs) is also evident at closely spaced promoters supporting convergent mRNA transcription. We suggest that basic building blocks of divergently transcribed core promoter pairs, in combination with the wealth of TSSs in mammalian genomes, provides a framework with which evolution shapes transcriptomes.}},

Here, we describe the application of CAGE (cap analysis of gene expression) to identify genome-wide TSSs used in root and shoot tissues of two maize (Zea mays) inbred lines (B73 and Mo17). Our studies indicate that most TSS clusters are sharp in maize, similar to mice, but distinct from Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, or zebra fish, in which a majority of genes have broad-shaped TSS clusters. We established that ∼38\% of maize promoters are characterized by a broader TATA-motif consensus, and this motif is significantly enriched in genes with sharp TSSs. A noteworthy plasticity in TSS usage between tissues and inbreds was uncovered, with ∼1500 genes showing significantly different dominant TSSs, sometimes affecting protein sequence by providing alternate translation initiation codons. We experimentally characterized instances in which this differential TSS utilization results in protein isoforms with additional domains or targeted to distinct subcellular compartments. These results provide important insights into TSS selection and gene expression in an agronomically important crop.}},

The two TF classes also had distinct chromatin-binding preferences and auto-regulatory properties. The regulatory range of a single TF bound within different topologically associating domains (TADs) depended on intrinsic TAD properties such as local gene density and G/C content, but also on the TAD chromatin state in specific cell types. Our results provide evidence that most TFs belong to one of these two functional classes, and that the regulatory range of long-range TFs is chromatin-state dependent.

In previous evolution experiments, mutations in a gene eliminated the fitness costs of PF activation. Since PF activation also provides drug resistance, exposing such compromised or broken mutants to both drug and inducer should create selection pressure to regain drug resistance and possibly PF function. Indeed, evolving 7 PF mutant strains in the presence of drug revealed 3 adaptation scenarios through genomic, PF-external mutations that elevate PF basal expression, possibly by affecting transcription, translation, degradation, and other fundamental cellular processes. Nonfunctional mutants gained drug resistance without ever developing high expression, while quasifunctional and dysfunctional PF mutants developed high expression nongenetically, which then diminished, although more slowly for dysfunctional mutants where revertant clones arose. These results highlight how intracellular context, such as the growth rate, can affect regulatory network dynamics and evolutionary dynamics, which has important consequences for understanding the evolution of drug resistance and developing future synthetic biology applications.}},

We propose a hierarchical model of transcriptional regulation during development in which core promoters define broad windows of opportunity for expression, by defining a limited range of transcription factors from which they are able to receive regulatory inputs. This two-tiered mechanism globally orchestrates developmental gene expression, including noncoding transcription on a scale that defies our current understanding of ontogenesis.

However, there remains a large amount of uncertainty regarding the frequency of these events and the mechanisms and speed of gene establishment. Here we describe a rigorous search for cases ofde novogene origination in the great apes. We analysed annotated proteomes as well as full genomic DNA and transcriptional and translational evidence. It is notable that results vary between database updates due to the fluctuating annotation of these genes. Nonetheless we identified 35de novogenes: 16 human-specific; 5 human and chimpanzee specific; and 14 that originated prior to the divergence of human, chimpanzee and gorilla and are found in all three genomes. The taxonomically-restricted distribution of these genes cannot be explained by loss in other lineages. Each gene is supported by an ORF-creating mutation that occurred within the primate lineage, and which is not polymorphic in any species. Similarly to previous studies we find that thede novogenes identified are short and frequently located near pre-existing genes. Also, they may be associated with Alu elements and prior transcription and RNA-splicing at the locus. Additionally, we report the first case of apparent independent lineage sorting of ade novogene. The gene is present in human and gorilla, whereas chimpanzee has the ancestral non-coding sequence. This indicates a long period of polymorphism prior to fixation and thus supports a model wherede novogenes may, at least initially, have a neutral effect on fitness.}},

Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loci in different compartments that had been in the same loop domain become more segregated. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation, but does affect a significant minority of active genes. In particular, cohesin loss causes superenhancers to co-localize, forming hundreds of links within and across chromosomes, and affecting the regulation of nearby genes. Cohesin restoration quickly reverses these effects, consistent with a model where loop extrusion is rapid.</p>}},

Our analysis provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining the evolution of green plants. Most inferred species relationships are well supported across multiple species tree and supermatrix analyses, but discordance among plastid and nuclear gene trees at a few important nodes highlights the complexity of plant genome evolution, including polyploidy, periods of rapid speciation, and extinction. Incomplete sorting of ancestral variation, polyploidization and massive expansions of gene families punctuate the evolutionary history of green plants. Notably, we find that large expansions of gene families preceded the origins of green plants, land plants and vascular plants, whereas whole-genome duplications are inferred to have occurred repeatedly throughout the evolution of flowering plants and ferns. The increasing availability of high-quality plant genome sequences and advances in functional genomics are enabling research on genome evolution across the green tree of life.

  abstract = {{The birth of new genes is an important motor of evolutionary innovation. Whereas many new genes arise by gene duplication, others originate at genomic regions that did not contain any genes or gene copies. Some of these newly expressed genes may acquire coding or non-coding functions and be preserved by natural selection. However, it is yet unclear which is the prevalence and underlying mechanisms of de novo gene emergence. In order to obtain a comprehensive view of this process, we have performed in-depth sequencing of the transcriptomes of four mammalian species—human, chimpanzee, macaque, and mouse—and subsequently compared the assembled transcripts and the corresponding syntenic genomic regions. This has resulted in the identification of over five thousand new multiexonic transcriptional events in human and/or chimpanzee that are not observed in the rest of species. Using comparative genomics, we show that the expression of these transcripts is associated with the gain of regulatory motifs upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and of U1 snRNP sites downstream of the TSS. In general, these transcripts show little evidence of purifying selection, suggesting that many of them are not functional. However, we find signatures of selection in a subset of de novo genes which have evidence of protein translation. Taken together, the data support a model in which frequently-occurring new transcriptional events in the genome provide the raw material for the evolution of new proteins.}},

  abstract = {{Gene bodies of vertebrates and flowering plants are occupied by the histone variant H3.3 and DNA methylation. The origin and significance of these profiles remain largely unknown. DNA methylation and H3.3 enrichment profiles over gene bodies are correlated and both have a similar dependence on gene transcription levels. This suggests a mechanistic link between H3.3 and gene body methylation. We engineered an H3.3 knockdown in Arabidopsis thaliana and observed transcription reduction that predominantly affects genes responsive to environmental cues. When H3.3 levels are reduced, gene bodies show a loss of DNA methylation correlated with transcription levels. To study the origin of changes in DNA methylation profiles when H3.3 levels are reduced, we examined genome-wide distributions of several histone H3 marks, H2A.Z, and linker histone H1. We report that in the absence of H3.3, H1 distribution increases in gene bodies in a transcription-dependent manner. We propose that H3.3 prevents recruitment of H1, inhibiting H1’s promotion of chromatin folding that restricts access to DNA methyltransferases responsible for gene body methylation. Thus, gene body methylation is likely shaped by H3.3 dynamics in conjunction with transcriptional activity.}},

To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively.

Isolated reports have shown that variants that create or disrupt uORFs can cause disease. Here, in a systematic genome-wide study using 15,708 whole genome sequences, we show that variants that create new upstream start codons, and variants disrupting stop sites of existing uORFs, are under strong negative selection. This selection signal is significantly stronger for variants arising upstream of genes intolerant to loss-of-function variants. Furthermore, variants creating uORFs that overlap the coding sequence show signals of selection equivalent to coding missense variants. Finally, we identify specific genes where modification of uORFs likely represents an important disease mechanism, and report a novel uORF frameshift variant upstream of NF2 in neurofibromatosis. Our results highlight uORF-perturbing variants as an under-recognised functional class that contribute to penetrant human disease, and demonstrate the power of large-scale population sequencing data in studying non-coding variant classes.

When supplied with either single host (allopatry), λ improved its binding to the available receptor while losing its ability to use the alternative. When evolving on both hosts together (sympatry), the viruses split into two lineages with divergent receptor preferences. Although the level of divergence varied among replicates, some lineages evolved reproductive isolation via genetic incompatibilities. This outcome indicates that, under suitable conditions, allopatric and sympatric speciation can occur with similar ease.}},

Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) has emerged as a popular gene expression profiling protocol, able to quantitate TSS usage by recognizing the 5′ end of capped RNA molecules. However, there is an increasing volume of studies in the literature suggesting that CAGE can also detect 5′ capping events which are transcription byproducts. These findings highlight the need for computational methods that can effectively remove the excessive amount of noise from CAGE samples, leading to accurate TSS annotation and promoter usage quantification. In this study, we present an annotation agnostic computational framework, DIANA Signal-TSS (DiS-TSS), that for the first time utilizes digital signal processing inspired features customized on the peculiarities of CAGE data. Features from the spatial and frequency domains are combined with a robustly trained Support Vector Machines (SVM) model to accurately distinguish between peaks related to real transcription initiation events and biological or protocol-induced noise. When benchmarked on experimentally derived data on active transcription marks as well as annotated TSSs, DiS-TSS was found to outperform existing implementations, by providing on average \textbackslashtextasciitilde11k positive predictions and an increase in performance by \textbackslashtextasciitilde5\% based on in the experimental and annotation-based evaluations.}},

The promoters of mammalian genes are commonly regulated by multiple distal enhancers, which physically interact within discrete chromatin domains.

To address this we developed Tri-C, a new chromosome conformation capture (3C) approach, to characterize concurrent chromatin interactions at individual alleles. Analysis by Tri-C identifies heterogeneous patterns of single-allele interactions between CTCF boundary elements, indicating that the formation of chromatin domains likely results from a dynamic process. Within these domains, we observe specific higher-order structures that involve simultaneous interactions between multiple enhancers and promoters. Such regulatory hubs provide a structural basis for understanding how multiple cis-regulatory elements act together to establish robust regulation of gene expression.}},

Diapause is a primary adaptation to environmental heterogeneity, and in D. melanogaster the propensity to enter diapause varies predictably with latitude and season. Here we performed global transcriptomic profiling of naturally occurring variation in diapause expression elicited by short day photoperiod and moderately low temperature in two tissue types associated with neuroendocrine and endocrine signaling, heads and ovaries. We show that diapause in D. melanogaster is an actively regulated phenotype at the transcriptional level, suggesting that diapause is not a simple physiological or reproductive quiescence. Differentially expressed genes and pathways are highly distinct in heads and ovaries, demonstrating that the diapause response is not uniform throughout the soma and suggesting that it may be comprised of functional modules associated with specific tissues. Genes down-regulated in heads of diapausing flies are significantly enriched for clinally varying SNPs and seasonally oscillating SNPs, consistent with the hypothesis that diapause is a driving phenotype of climatic adaptation. We also show that chromosome location-based co-regulation of gene expression is present in the transcriptional regulation of diapause. Taken together, these results demonstrate that diapause is a complex phenotype actively regulated in multiple tissues, and support the hypothesis that natural variation in diapause propensity underlies adaptation to spatially and temporally varying selective pressures.}},

Alternative transcript‐X encodes a smaller protein, isoform‐X, which lacks the amino‐terminal ß‐catenin binding domain of the standard mouse αT‐catenin protein, and is therefore unable to restore cell‐cell adhesion in an α‐catenin‐negative colon carcinoma cell line.

  abstract = {{<h2>Summary</h2><p>The transition from hunting and gathering to farming involved profound cultural and technological changes. In Western and Central Europe, these changes occurred rapidly and synchronously after the arrival of early farmers of Anatolian origin [1–3], who largely replaced the local Mesolithic hunter-gatherers [1, 4–6]. Further east, in the Baltic region, the transition was gradual, with little or no genetic input from incoming farmers [7]. Here we use ancient DNA to investigate the relationship between hunter-gatherers and farmers in the Lower Danube basin, a geographically intermediate area that is characterized by a rapid Neolithic transition but also by the presence of archaeological evidence that points to cultural exchange, and thus possible admixture, between hunter-gatherers and farmers. We recovered four human paleogenomes (1.1× to 4.1× coverage) from Romania spanning a time transect between 8.8 thousand years ago (kya) and 5.4 kya and supplemented them with two Mesolithic genomes (1.7× and 5.3×) from Spain to provide further context on the genetic background of Mesolithic Europe. Our results show major Western hunter-gatherer (WHG) ancestry in a Romanian Eneolithic sample with a minor, but sizeable, contribution from Anatolian farmers, suggesting multiple admixture events between hunter-gatherers and farmers. Dietary stable-isotope analysis of this sample suggests a mixed terrestrial/aquatic diet. Our results provide support for complex interactions among hunter-gatherers and farmers in the Danube basin, demonstrating that in some regions, demic and cultural diffusion were not mutually exclusive, but merely the ends of a continuum for the process of Neolithization.</p>}},

  abstract = {{Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease. Samples of different body regions from hundreds of human donors are used to study how genetic variation influences gene expression levels in 44 disease-relevant tissues. The GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) Consortium has established a reference catalogue and associated tissue biobank for gene-expression levels across individuals for diverse tissues of the human body, with a broad sampling of normal, non-diseased human tissues from postmortem donors. The consortium now presents the deepest survey of gene expression across multiple tissues and individuals to date, encompassing 7,051 samples from 449 donors across 44 human tissues. Barbara Engelhardt and colleagues characterize the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression, and find that most genes are regulated by genetic variation near to the affected gene. In accompanying GTEx studies, Alexis Battle, Stephen Montgomery and colleagues examine the effect of rare genetic variation on gene expression across human tissues, Daniel MacArthur and colleagues systematically survey the landscape of X chromosome inactivation in human tissues, and Jin Billy Li and colleagues provide a comprehensive cross-species analysis of adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing in mammals. In an accompanying News \& Views, Michelle Ward and Yoav Gilad put the latest results in context and discuss how these findings are helping to crack the regulatory code of the human genome.}},

We identify a linear projection that reveals population structure in gene expression data. Our approach relies on the coupling of the principal components of genotype to the principal components of gene expression via canonical correlation analysis. Futhermore, we analyze the variance of each gene within the projection matrix to determine which genes significantly influence the projection.

Protein family classification can significantly contribute to the delineation of functional diversity of homologous proteins, the prediction of function based on domain architecture or the presence of sequence motifs as well as comparative genomics, providing valuable evolutionary insights. We present a novel approach called TRIBE-MCL for rapid and accurate clustering of protein sequences into families. The method relies on the Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm for the assignment of proteins into families based on precomputed sequence similarity information. This novel approach does not suffer from the problems that normally hinder other protein sequence clustering algorithms, such as the presence of multi-domain proteins, promiscuous domains and fragmented proteins. The method has been rigorously tested and validated on a number of very large databases, including SwissProt, InterPro, SCOP and the draft human genome. Our results indicate that the method is ideally suited to the rapid and accurate detection of protein families on a large scale. The method has been used to detect and categorise protein families within the draft human genome and the resulting families have been used to annotate a large proportion of human proteins.}},

Relatedly, the vast majority of candidate regulatory elements have yet to be functionally validated. Here, we describe a CRISPR-based system that uses pairs of guide RNAs (gRNAs) to program thousands of kilobase-scale deletions that deeply scan across a targeted region in a tiling fashion (“ScanDel”). We applied ScanDel to HPRT1, the housekeeping gene underlying Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an X-linked recessive disorder. Altogether, we programmed 4,342 overlapping 1 and 2 kb deletions that tiled 206 kb centered on HPRT1 (including 87 kb upstream and 79 kb downstream) with median 27-fold redundancy per base. We functionally assayed programmed deletions in parallel by selecting for loss of HPRT function with 6-thioguanine. As expected, sequencing gRNA pairs before and after selection confirmed that all HPRT1 exons are needed. However, HPRT1 function was robust to deletion of any intergenic or deeply intronic non-coding region, indicating that proximal regulatory sequences are sufficient for HPRT1 expression. Although our screen did identify the disruption of exon-proximal non-coding sequences (e.g., the promoter) as functionally consequential, long-read sequencing revealed that this signal was driven by rare, imprecise deletions that extended into exons. Our results suggest that no singular distal regulatory element is required for HPRT1 expression and that distal mutations are unlikely to contribute substantially to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome burden. Further application of ScanDel could shed light on the role of regulatory mutations in disease at other loci while also facilitating a deeper understanding of endogenous gene regulation.}},

Using these variance estimates in a dosage outlier test (ANEVA-DOT) applied to AE data from 70 Mendelian muscular disease patients showed accuracy in detecting genes with pathogenic variants in previously resolved cases and led to one confirmed and several potential new diagnoses. Using our reference estimates from GTEx data, ANEVA-DOT can be incorporated in rare disease diagnostic pipelines to use RNA-sequencing data more effectively.

Deletion analyses in B, T, and embryonic stem cells (ESC) identified a core of essential subunits required for Pol II recruitment genome-wide. Conversely, loss of non-essential subunits mostly affects promoters linked to multiple enhancers. Contrary to current models, however, mMED and Pol II are dispensable to physically tether regulatory DNA, a topological activity requiring architectural proteins. Cryo-EM analysis revealed a conserved core, with non-essential subunits increasing structural complexity of the tail module, a primary transcription factor target. Changes in tail structure markedly increase Pol II and kinase module interactions. We propose that Mediator's structural pliability enables it to integrate and transmit regulatory signals and act as a functional, rather than an architectural bridge, between promoters and enhancers.</p>}},

In this report, we describe our attempts to identify the taxonomic identity of the cell line through immunological and molecular techniques. Immunohistochemical screening for the expression of a suite of invertebrate neuropeptides gave negative results, precluding an invertebrate neural origin. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing for the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxydase I, and 18S ribosomal RNA genes that had been widely used to confirm species identity, could not confirm the OLGA-PH-J/92 cells as originating from crayfish. Subsequent attempts to identify the cells provided moderate homology (82\%) to Gephyramoeba sp. (AF293897) following PCR amplification of an 18S rDNA fragment after a BLAST search. A literature search provided morphological evidence of the similarity of OLGA-PH-J/92 to the Gephyramoeba distributed by the American Type Culture Collection as ATCC 50654, which also had been misidentified and was renamed Acramoeba dendroida (Smirnov et al., Eur J Protistol 44:35-44, 2008). The morphology of the OLGA-PH-J/92 cells which remains identical to the original report (Neumann et al., In Vivo 14:691-698, 2000) and matched corresponding micrographs that were available from the ATCC before the cell line was dropped from their catalog (ATCC CRL 1494) is very similar to A. dendroida and could thus belong to the Acramoebidae.

Moreover, loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) often contain multiple SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD), any of which may be causal. Thus, determining the effect of these multiple variant SNPs on target transcript levels has been a major challenge. Here, we provide evidence that for six common autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and ulcerative colitis), the GWAS association arises from multiple polymorphisms in LD that map to clusters of enhancer elements active in the same cell type. This finding suggests a "multiple enhancer variant" hypothesis for common traits, where several variants in LD impact multiple enhancers and cooperatively affect gene expression. Using a novel method to delineate enhancer-gene interactions, we show that multiple enhancer variants within a given locus typically target the same gene. Using available data from HapMap and B lymphoblasts as a model system, we provide evidence at numerous loci that multiple enhancer variants cooperatively contribute to altered expression of their gene targets. The effects on target transcript levels tend to be modest and can be either gain- or loss-of-function. Additionally, the genes associated with multiple enhancer variants encode proteins that are often functionally related and enriched in common pathways.

We show that, regardless of genome size, essentially all animals have comparable amounts of introns and intergenic sequence, with nearly all deviations dominated by increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations.

CREs are unevenly distributed across the genome, giving rise to individual CREs and clusters of CREs (COREs). Technical and biological features hinder CORE identification. We addressed these issues by developing an unsupervised machine learning approach termed clustering of genomic regions analysis method (CREAM). CREAM automates CORE detection from chromatin accessibility profiles that are enriched in CREs strongly bound by master transcription regulators, proximal to highly expressed and essential genes, and discriminating cell identity. Although COREs share similarities with super-enhancers, we highlight differences in terms of the genomic distribution and structure of these cis-regulatory units. We further show the enhanced value of COREs over super-enhancers to identify master transcription regulators, highly expressed and essential genes defining cell identity. COREs enrich at topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries. They are also preferentially bound by the chromatin looping factors CTCF and cohesin, in contrast to super-enhancers, forming clusters of CTCF and cohesin binding regions and defining homotypic clusters of transcription regulator binding regions (HCTs). Finally, we show the clinical utility of CREAM to identify COREs across chromatin accessibility profiles to stratify more than 400 tumor samples according to their cancer type and to delineate cancer type-specific active biological pathways. Collectively, our results support the utility of CREAM to delineate COREs underlying, with greater accuracy than individual CREs or super-enhancers, the cell-type-specific biological underpinning across a wide range of normal and cancer cell types.}},

These models use adaptively constructed negative set which iteratively improves the models discriminative ability. The developed promoter identification models significantly outperform the previously developed promoter prediction programs by considerably reducing the number of false positive predictions.

Herein, we present a study investigating the rates and patterns of new gene-driven evolution of GGI networks in the human and mouse genomes. We examine the network topological and functional evolution of new genes that originated at various stages in the human and mouse lineages by constructing and analyzing three different GGI datasets. We find a large number of new genes integrated into GGI networks throughout vertebrate evolution. These genes experienced a gradual integration process into GGI networks, starting on the network periphery and gradually becoming highly connected hubs, and acquiring pleiotropic and essential functions. We identify a few human lineage-specific hub genes that have evolved brain development-related functions. Finally, we explore the possible underlying mechanisms driving the GGI network evolution and the observed patterns of new gene integration process. Our results unveil a remarkable network topological integration process of new genes: over 5000 new genes were integrated into the ancestral GGI networks of human and mouse; new genes gradually acquire increasing number of gene partners; some human-specific genes evolved into hub structure with critical phenotypic effects. Our data cast new conceptual insights into the evolution of genetic networks.}},

  abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity allows organisms to produce alternative phenotypes under different conditions and represents one of the most important ways by which organisms adaptively respond to the environment. However, the relationship between phenotypic plasticity and molecular evolution remains poorly understood. We addressed this issue by investigating the evolution of genes associated with phenotypically plastic castes, sexes, and developmental stages of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. We first determined if genes associated with phenotypic plasticity in S. invicta evolved at a rapid rate, as predicted under theoretical models. We found that genes differentially expressed between S. invicta castes, sexes, and developmental stages all exhibited elevated rates of evolution compared with ubiquitously expressed genes. We next investigated the evolutionary history of genes associated with the production of castes. Surprisingly, we found that orthologs of caste-biased genes in S. invicta and the social bee Apis mellifera evolved rapidly in lineages without castes. Thus, in contrast to some theoretical predictions, our results suggest that rapid rates of molecular evolution may not arise primarily as a consequence of phenotypic plasticity. Instead, genes evolving under relaxed purifying selection may more readily adopt new forms of biased expression during the evolution of alternate phenotypes. These results suggest that relaxed selective constraint on protein-coding genes is an important and underappreciated element in the evolutionary origin of phenotypic plasticity.}},

PROMPTs are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. Similarly, active enhancer regions in animals initiate transcription of exosome-sensitive enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Previous studies based on nascent RNA approaches concluded that Arabidopsis thaliana does not produce PROMPTs. Here, we used steady-state RNA sequencing methods in mutants defective in nuclear RNA decay, including by the exosome, to reassess the existence of PROMPTs and eRNAs in A. thaliana. While PROMPTs are overall rare in A. thaliana, about 100 clear cases of exosome-sensitive PROMPTs and 113 loci producing eRNA-like transcripts were identified. In addition, we found \textbackslashtextasciitilde200 transcription start sites within 39-UTR-encoding regions that produce unspliced exosome-sensitive antisense RNAs covering much of the cognate pre-mRNA. A typical representative of this class of RNAs is the previously characterized non-coding RNA controlling the expression of the key seed dormancy regulator, DELAY OF GERMINATION1. Exosome-sensitive antisense RNAs are overrepresented in transcription factor genes, suggesting a potential for widespread control of gene expression.

In the past few years, single cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful strategy for overcoming this challenge. However, its adoption has been limited by a paucity of methods that are at once simple to implement and cost effective to scale massively. Here, we describe a combinatorial indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of large numbers of single cells or single nuclei without requiring the physical isolation of each cell (Single cell Combinatorial Indexing RNA-seq or sci-RNA-seq). We show that sci-RNA-seq can be used to efficiently profile the transcriptomes of tens-of-thousands of single cells per experiment, and demonstrate that we can stratify cell types from these data. Key advantages of sci-RNA-seq over contemporary alternatives such as droplet-based single cell RNA-seq include sublinear cost scaling, a reliance on widely available reagents and equipment, the ability to concurrently process many samples within a single workflow, compatibility with methanol fixation of cells, cell capture based on DNA content rather than cell size, and the flexibility to profile either cells or nuclei. As a demonstration of sci-RNA-seq, we profile the transcriptomes of 42,035 single cells from C. elegans at the L2 stage, effectively 50-fold "shotgun cellular coverage" of the somatic cell composition of this organism at this stage. We identify 27 distinct cell types, including rare cell types such as the two distal tip cells of the developing gonad, estimate consensus expression profiles and define cell-type specific and selective genes. Given that C. elegans is the only organism with a fully mapped cellular lineage, these data represent a rich resource for future methods aimed at defining cell types and states.

We find that the first enhancer in a chain that directly contacts the target promoter is commonly located at a greater genomic distance from the promoter than the second enhancer in a chain, 96 kb vs. 45 kb, respectively. The first enhancer also features higher similarity to the promoter in terms of tissue specificity and higher enrichment of loop factors, suggestive of a stable primary contact with the promoter. In contrast, a chain of enhancers which connects to the target promoter through a neutral DNA segment instead of an enhancer is associated with a significant decrease in target gene expression, suggesting an important role of the first enhancer in initiating transcription using\&nbsp;the target promoter and bridging the promoter with other regulatory elements in the locus. The widespread chained structure of gene enhancers in humans reveals that the primary, critical enhancer is distal, commonly located further away than other enhancers.

Theories addressing the evolutionary origin of eukaryotic endomembranes have overlooked the outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that bacteria, archaea, and mitochondria secrete into their surroundings. We propose that the eukaryotic endomembrane system originated from bacterial OMVs released by the mitochondrial ancestor within the cytosol of its archaeal host at eukaryote origin. Confined within the host's cytosol, OMVs accumulated naturally, fusing either with each other or with the host's plasma membrane. This matched the host's archaeal secretory pathway for cotranslational protein insertion with outward bound mitochondrial-derived vesicles consisting of bacterial lipids, forging a primordial, secretory endoplasmic reticulum as the cornerstone of the eukaryotic endomembrane system.

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), which quantify the regulatory activity of large libraries of DNA sequences in parallel, are a powerful approach to characterize this relationship. We present MPRA-DragoNN, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to predict and interpret the regulatory activity of DNA sequences as measured by MPRAs. While our method is generally applicable to a variety of MPRA designs, here we trained our model on the Sharpr-MPRA dataset that measures the activity of \textbackslashtextasciitilde500,000 constructs tiling 15,720 regulatory regions in human K562 and HepG2 cell lines. MPRA-DragoNN predictions were moderately correlated (Spearman ρ = 0.28) with measured activity and were within range of replicate concordance of the assay. State-of-the-art model interpretation methods revealed high-resolution predictive regulatory sequence features that overlapped transcription factor (TF) binding motifs. We used the model to investigate the cell type and chromatin state preferences of predictive TF motifs. We explored the ability of our model to predict the allelic effects of regulatory variants in an independent MPRA experiment and fine map putative functional SNPs in loci associated with lipid traits. Our results suggest that interpretable deep learning models trained on MPRA data have the potential to reveal meaningful patterns in regulatory DNA sequences and prioritize regulatory genetic variants, especially as larger, higher-quality datasets are produced.}},

However, a number of genes display highly unstable promoter Pol II, suggesting that paused polymerase might dissociate from template DNA at these promoters and release a short, non-productive mRNA. Here, we report that paused Pol II can be actively destabilized by the Integrator complex. Specifically, Integrator utilizes its RNA endonuclease activity to cleave nascent RNA and drive termination of paused Pol II. These findings uncover a previously unappreciated mechanism of metazoan gene repression, akin to bacterial transcription attenuation, wherein promoter-proximal Pol II is prevented from entering productive elongation through factor-regulated termination.

This can provide insights into how multiple regulatory elements cooperate or compete for transcriptional activation. We have used these techniques in a mouse model in which the α-globin domain is extended to include several additional genes. This allows us to determine how the interactions of the α-globin super-enhancer are distributed between multiple promoters in a single domain. Our data show that gene promoters do not form mutually exclusive interactions with the super-enhancer, but all interact simultaneously in a single complex. These finding show that promoters within the same domain do not structurally compete for interactions with enhancers, but form a regulatory hub structure, consistent with the recent model of transcriptional activation in phase-separated nuclear condensates.</p>}},

  abstract = {{Recent studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in mammals and Drosophila have shown an excess of amino acid variation within species (replacement polymorphism) relative to the number of silent and replacement differences fixed between species. To examine further this pattern of nonneutral mtDNA evolution, we present sequence data for the ND3 and ND5 genes from 59 lines of Drosophila melanogaster and 29 lines of D. simulans. Of interest are the frequency spectra of silent and replacement polymorphisms, and potential variation among genes and taxa in the departures from neutral expectations. The Drosophila ND3 and ND5 data show no significant excess of replacement polymorphism using the McDonald-Kreitman test. These data are in contrast to significant departures from neutrality for the ND3 gene in mammals and other genes in Drosophila mtDNA (cytochrome b and ATPase 6). Pooled across genes, however, both Drosophila and human mtDNA show very significant excesses of amino acid polymorphism. Silent polymorphisms at ND5 show a significantly higher variance in frequency than replacement polymorphisms, and the latter show a significant skew toward low frequencies (Tajima's D = -1.954). These patterns are interpreted in light of the nearly neutral theory where mildly deleterious amino acid haplotypes are observed as ephemeral variants within species but do not contribute to divergence. The patterns of polymorphism and divergence at charge-altering amino acid sites are presented for the Drosophila ND5 gene to examine the evolution of functionally distinct mutations. Excess charge-altering polymorphism is observed at the carboxyl terminal and excess charge-altering divergence is detected at the amino terminal. While the mildly deleterious model fits as a net effect in the evolution of nonrecombining mitochondrial genomes, these data suggest that opposing evolutionary pressures may act on different regions of mitochondrial genes and genomes.}},

Here, we present ORF Capture-Seq (OCS), a flexible and cost-effective method that addresses both challenges for targeted full-length isoform sequencing applications using collections of cloned ORFs as probes.

Focusing on regulatory motifs overrepresented at specific locations within or near the promoter, we find that a surprisingly large number of cis-regulatory elements have been subject to coordinated genome-wide modifications during vertebrate evolution, such that the motif frequency changes on a single branch of vertebrate phylogeny. This was found to be the case even between closely related mammal species, with nearly a third of all location-specific consensus motifs exhibiting significant modifications within the human or mouse lineage since their divergence. Many of these modifications are likely to be compensatory changes throughout the genome following changes in protein factor binding affinities, whereas others may be due to changes in mutation rates or effective population size. The likelihood that this happened many times during vertebrate evolution highlights the need to examine additional taxa and to understand the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of protein-DNA interactions.}},

This approach allowed us to extract APA isoforms that are subjected to differential regulation and provided us with a platform to interrogate the molecular regulatory pathways that shape APA profiles in different subcellular locations. Here, we show that APA isoforms with shorter 3' UTRs tend to be overrepresented in the cytoplasm and appear to be cell-type-specific events. Nuclear retention of longer APA isoforms occurs and is partly a result of incomplete splicing contributing to the observed cytoplasmic bias of transcripts with shorter 3' UTRs. We demonstrate that the endoribonuclease III, DICER1, contributes to the establishment of subcellular APA profiles not only by expected cytoplasmic miRNA-mediated destabilization of APA mRNA isoforms, but also by affecting polyadenylation site choice.}},

  abstract = {{Transcription start site (TSS) evolution remains largely undescribed in Drosophila, likely due to limited annotations in non-melanogaster species. In this study, we introduce a concise new method that selectively sequences from the 5′-end of mRNA and used it to identify TSS in four Drosophila species, including Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. pseudoobscura. For verification, we compared our results in D. melanogaster with known annotations, published 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends data, and with RNAseq from the same mRNA pool. Then, we paired 2,849 D. melanogaster TSS with its closest equivalent TSS in each species (likely to be its true ortholog) using the available multiple sequence alignments. Most of the D. melanogaster TSSs were successfully paired with an ortholog in each species (83\%, 86\%, and 55\% for D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. pseudoobscura, respectively). On the basis of the number and distribution of reads mapped at each TSS, we also estimated promoter-specific expression (PSE) and TSS peak shape, respectively. Among paired TSS orthologs, the location and promoter activity were largely conserved. TSS location appears important as PSE, and TSS peak shape was more frequently divergent among TSS that had moved. Unpaired TSS were surprisingly common in D. pseudoobscura. An increased mutation rate upstream of TSS might explain this pattern. We found an enrichment of ribosomal protein genes among diverged TSS, suggesting that TSS evolution is not uniform across the genome.}},

Nevertheless, it is often unclear what fitness actually is, and its meaning often depends on the context. Here we argue that fitness should not be a basal ingredient in verbal or mathematical descriptions of evolution. Instead, we propose that evolutionary birth-death processes, in which individuals give birth and die at ever-changing rates, should be the basis of evolutionary theory, because such processes capture the fundamental events that generate evolutionary dynamics. In evolutionary birth-death processes, fitness is at best a derived quantity, and owing to the potential complexity of such processes, there is no guarantee that there is a simple scalar, such as fitness, that would describe long-term evolutionary outcomes. We discuss how evolutionary birth-death processes can provide useful perspectives on a number of central issues in evolution.}},

  doi = {10.1101/gr.193359.115}, 
  abstract = {{Identification of functional genetic variants and elucidation of their regulatory mechanisms represent significant challenges of the post-genomic era. A poorly understood topic is the involvement of genetic variants in mediating post-transcriptional RNA processing, including alternative splicing. Thus far, little is known about the genomic, evolutionary and regulatory features of genetically modulated alternative splicing (GMAS). Here, we systematically identified intronic tag variants for genetic modulation of alternative splicing using RNA-seq data specific to cellular compartments. Combined with our previous method that identifies exonic tags for GMAS, this study yielded 622 GMAS exons. We observed that GMAS events are highly cell-type independent, indicating that splicing-altering genetic variants could have widespread function across cell types. Interestingly, GMAS genes, exons and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) all demonstrated positive selection or accelerated evolution in primates. We predicted that GMAS SNVs often alter binding of splicing factors, with SRSF1 affecting the most GMAS events and demonstrating global allelic binding bias. However, in contrast to their GMAS targets, the predicted splicing factors are more conserved than expected, suggesting that cis-regulatory variation is the major driving force of splicing evolution. Moreover, GMAS-related splicing factors had stronger consensus motifs than expected, consistent with their susceptibility to SNV-disruption. Intriguingly, GMAS SNVs in general do not alter the strongest consensus position of the splicing factor motif, except the >100 GMAS SNVs in linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms reported by genome-wide association studies. Our study reports many GMAS events and enables a better understanding of the evolutionary and regulatory features of this phenomenon.}},

Often, however, tissues must first be dissociated, and crucial information about spatial relationships and communication between cells is thus lost. Existing approaches to reconstruct tissues assign spatial positions to each cell, independently of other cells, by using spatial patterns of expression of marker genes5,6—which often do not exist. Here we reconstruct spatial positions with little or no prior knowledge, by searching for spatial arrangements of sequenced cells in which nearby cells have transcriptional profiles that are often (but not always) more similar than cells that are farther apart. We formulate this task as a generalized optimal-transport problem for probabilistic embedding and derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve it. We reconstruct the spatial expression of genes in mammalian liver and intestinal epithelium, fly and zebrafish embryos, sections from the mammalian cerebellum and whole kidney, and use the reconstructed tissues to identify genes that are spatially informative. Thus, we identify an organization principle for the spatial expression of genes in animal tissues, which can be exploited to infer meaningful probabilities of spatial position for individual cells. Our framework (‘novoSpaRc’) can incorporate prior spatial information and is compatible with any single-cell technology. Additional principles that underlie the cartography of gene expression can be tested using our approach. A new computational framework, novoSpaRc, leverages single-cell data to reconstruct spatial context for cells and spatial expression across tissues and organisms, on the basis of an organization principle for gene expression.}},

We studied RNA synthesis and degradation at the transcription start site level, uncovering the impact of differential promoter usage on transcript stability. We quantified transcription from cis -regulatory elements without influence of RNA turnover, and identified enhancer-promoter pairs which were simultaneously activated upon cellular stimulation. By integrating NET-CAGE data with chromatin interaction maps, we revealed that cis -regulatory elements are topologically connected according to their cell-type specificity. We discovered new enhancers with high sensitivity, and delineated primary locations of transcription within super-enhancers.

The data include 1173 occurrences of six unrelated insertion sequences (IS1, IS2, IS3, IS4, IS5 and IS30). The number of insertion elements per strain, and the sizes of DNA restriction fragments containing them, is highly variable and can be used to discriminate even among closely related strains. The occurrence and abundance of pairs of unrelated insertion sequences are apparently statistically independent, but significant correlations result from stratifications in the reference collection. However, there is a highly significant positive association among the insertion sequences considered in the aggregate. Nine branching process models, which differ in assumptions regarding the regulation of transposition and the effect of copy number on fitness, have been evaluated with regard to their fit of the observed distributions. No single model fits all copy number distributions. The best models incorporate no regulation of transposition and a moderate to strong decrease in fitness with increasing copy number for IS1 and IS5, strong regulation of transposition and a negligible to weak decrease in fitness with increasing copy number for IS3, and less than strong regulation of transposition for IS2, IS4 and IS30.}},

Here we describe a planctomycete bacterium, 'Candidatus Uab amorphum', which is able to engulf other bacteria and small eukaryotic cells through a phagocytosis-like mechanism. Observations via light and electron microscopy suggest that this bacterium digests prey cells in specific compartments. With the possible exception of a gene encoding an actin-like protein, analysis of the 'Ca. Uab amorphum' genomic sequence does not reveal any genes homologous to eukaryotic phagocytosis genes, suggesting that cell engulfment in this microorganism is probably not homologous to eukaryotic phagocytosis.

  abstract = {{Evolutionary theory has been extended almost continually since the evolutionary synthesis (ES), but except for the much greater importance afforded genetic drift, the principal tenets of the ES have been strongly supported. Adaptations are attributable to the sorting of genetic variation by natural selection, which remains the only known cause of increase in fitness. Mutations are not adaptively directed, but as principal authors of the ES recognized, the material (structural) bases of biochemistry and development affect the variety of phenotypic variations that arise by mutation and recombination. Against this historical background, I analyse major propositions in the movement for an ‘extended evolutionary synthesis’. ‘Niche construction' is a new label for a wide variety of well-known phenomena, many of which have been extensively studied, but (as with every topic in evolutionary biology) some aspects may have been understudied. There is no reason to consider it a neglected ‘process’ of evolution. The proposition that phenotypic plasticity may engender new adaptive phenotypes that are later genetically assimilated or accommodated is theoretically plausible; it may be most likely when the new phenotype is not truly novel, but is instead a slight extension of a reaction norm already shaped by natural selection in similar environments. However, evolution in new environments often compensates for maladaptive plastic phenotypic responses. The union of population genetic theory with mechanistic understanding of developmental processes enables more complete understanding by joining ultimate and proximate causation; but the latter does not replace or invalidate the former. Newly discovered molecular phenomena have been easily accommodated in the past by elaborating orthodox evolutionary theory, and it appears that the same holds today for phenomena such as epigenetic inheritance. In several of these areas, empirical evidence is needed to evaluate enthusiastic speculation. Evolutionary theory will continue to be extended, but there is no sign that it requires emendation.}},

In this study, we generated quantitative maps of transcription start site (TSS) at a single-nucleotide resolution for S. cerevisiae grown in nine different conditions using no-amplification non-tagging Cap analysis of gene expression (nAnT-iCAGE) sequencing. Based on 337 million uniquely mapped CAGE tags, we mapped \textbackslashtextasciitilde1 million well-supported TSSs, suggesting highly pervasive transcription initiation in the compact genome of yeast. The comprehensive TSS maps allowed us to identify core promoters for \textbackslashtextasciitilde96\% verified protein-coding genes and to revise the predicted translation start codon for 183 genes. We found that 56\% of yeast genes have at least two core promoters and alternative usage of different core promoters in a gene is widespread in response to changing environments. More importantly, most core promoter shifts are coupled with differential gene expression, indicating that core promoter shift might play an important role in controlling transcriptional activity of yeast genes. Based on their dynamic activities, we divided yeast core promoters as constitutive core promoters (55\%) and inducible core promoters (45\%). The two classes of core promoters exhibit distinctive patterns in transcriptional abundance, chromatin structure, promoter shape, and sequence context. In summary, the quantitative TSS maps generated by this study improved the annotation of yeast genome, and revealed a highly pervasive and dynamic nature of transcription initiation in yeast.</p>}},

Here, we describe a systematic genome-wide study of variants that create and disrupt human uORFs, and explore their role in human disease using 15,708 whole genome sequences collected by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) project. We show that 14,897 variants that create new start codons upstream of the canonical coding sequence (CDS), and 2,406 variants disrupting the stop site of existing uORFs, are under strong negative selection. Furthermore, variants creating uORFs that overlap the CDS show signals of selection equivalent to coding missense variants, and uORF-perturbing variants are under strong selection when arising upstream of known disease genes and genes intolerant to loss-of-function variants. Finally, we identify specific genes where perturbation of uORFs is likely to represent an important disease mechanism, and report a novel uORF frameshift variant upstream of NF2 in families with neurofibromatosis. Our results highlight uORF-perturbing variants as an important and under-recognised functional class that can contribute to penetrant human disease, and demonstrate the power of large-scale population sequencing data to study the deleteriousness of specific classes of non-coding variants.}},

  abstract = {{Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated by enhancer-promoter interactions but the molecular mechanisms that govern specificity have remained elusive. Genome-wide studies utilizing STARR-seq identified two enhancer classes in Drosophila that interact with different core promoters: housekeeping enhancers (hkCP) and developmental enhancers (dCP). We hypothesized that the two enhancer classes are occupied by distinct architectural proteins, affecting their enhancer-promoter contacts. By evaluating ChIP-seq occupancy of architectural proteins, typical enhancer-associated proteins, and histone modifications, we determine that both enhancer classes are enriched for RNA Polymerase II, CBP, and architectural proteins but there are also distinctions. hkCP enhancers contain H3K4me3 and exclusively bind Cap-H2, Chromator, DREF and Z4, whereas dCP enhancers contain H3K4me1 and are more enriched for Rad21 and Fs(1)h-L. Additionally, we map the interactions of each enhancer class utilizing a Hi-C dataset with <1 kb resolution. Results suggest that hkCP enhancers are more likely to form multi-TSS interaction networks and be associated with topologically associating domain (TAD) borders, while dCP enhancers are more often bound to one or two TSSs and are enriched at chromatin loop anchors. The data support a model suggesting that the unique architectural protein occupancy within enhancers is one contributor to enhancer-promoter interaction specificity.}},

These studies have generally assumed that populations of living wild rice, O. rufipogon, are descendants of the ancestral population that gave rise to domesticated rice, but relatively little attention has been paid to the origins and history of wild rice itself. Here, we investigate the genetic ancestry of wild rice by analyzing a diverse panel of rice genomes consisting of 203 domesticated and 446 wild rice accessions. We show that most modern wild rice is heavily admixed with domesticated rice through both pollen and seed mediated gene flow. In fact, much presumed wild rice may simply represent different stages of feralized domesticated rice. In line with this hypothesis, many presumed wild rice varieties show remnants of the effects of selective sweeps in previously identified domestication genes, as well as evidence of recent selection in flowering genes possibly associated with the feralization process. Furthermore, there is a distinct geographical pattern of gene flow from aus, indica and japonica varieties into co-located wild rice. We also show that admixture from aus and indica is more recent than gene flow from japonica, possibly consistent with an earlier spread of japonica varieties. We argue that wild rice populations should be considered a hybrid swarm, connected to domesticated rice by continuous and extensive gene flow.}},

The most common approach to reference-based genome assembly is a single round of alignment followed by quality filtering and variant detection. We evaluated variations and extensions of this approach, and settled on an assembly strategy that utilizes two alignment programs and incorporates both substitutions and short indels to construct an updated reference for a second round of mapping prior to final variant detection. Utilizing this approach, we reassembled published D. melanogaster population genomic data sets and added unpublished genomes from several sub-Saharan populations. Most notably, we present aligned data from phase 3 of the Drosophila Population Genomics Project (DPGP3), which provides 197 genomes from a single ancestral range population of D. melanogaster (from Zambia). The large sample size, high genetic diversity, and potentially simpler demographic history of the DPGP3 sample will make this a highly valuable resource for fundamental population genetic research. The complete set of assemblies described here, termed the Drosophila Genome Nexus, presently comprises 623 consistently aligned genomes, and is publicly available in multiple formats with supporting documentation and bioinformatic tools.

To take full advantage of the resultant information, we have developed maximum-likelihood (ML) methods for calling genotypes from high-throughput sequencing data. As the statistical uncertainties associated with sequencing data depend on depths of coverage, we have developed two types of genotype callers. One approach is appropriate for low-coverage sequencing data, and incorporates population-level information on genotype frequencies and error rates pre-estimated by an ML method. Performance evaluation using computer simulations and human data shows that the proposed framework yields less biased estimates of allele frequencies and more accurate genotype calls than current widely used methods. Another type of genotype caller applies to high-coverage sequencing data, requires no prior genotype-frequency estimates, and makes no assumption on the number of alleles at a polymorphic site. Using computer simulations, we determine the depth of coverage necessary to accurately characterize polymorphisms using this second method. We applied the proposed method to high-coverage (mean 18×) sequencing data of 83 clones from a population of Daphnia pulex . The results show that the proposed method enables conservative and reasonably powerful detection of polymorphisms with arbitrary numbers of alleles. We have extended the proposed method to the analysis of genomic data for polyploid organisms, showing that calling accurate polyploid genotypes requires much higher coverage than diploid genotypes.}},

Based on the ENCODE annotation and integration of sequence motifs as well as three-dimensional chromatin data, we have undertaken a re-analysis of occupancy and sequence patterns in human promoters. We identify clear groups of CAAT-box and E-box sequence motif containing promoters, as well as a group of promoters whose interaction with an enhancer appears to be mediated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding on the promoter. We also extend our analysis to inactive promoters, showing that only a surprisingly small number of inactive promoters is repressed by the polycomb complex. We also identify combinatorial patterns of transcription factor interactions indicated by the ChIP-seq signals. Our analysis defines subgroups of promoters characterized by stereotypic patterns of transcription factor occupancy, and combinations of specific sequence patterns which are required for their binding. This grouping provides new hypotheses concerning the assembly and dynamics of transcription factor complexes at their respective promoter groups, as well as questions on the evolutionary origin of these groups.}},

  abstract = {{Chromosomal inversions are an ubiquitous feature of genetic variation. Theoretical models describe several mechanisms by which inversions can drive adaptation and be maintained as polymorphisms. While inversions have been shown previously to be under selection, or contain genetic variation under selection, the specific phenotypic consequences of inversions leading to their maintenance remain unclear. Here we use genomic sequence and expression data from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel to explore the effects of two cosmopolitan inversions, In(2L)t and In(3R)Mo, on patterns of transcriptional variation. We demonstrate that each inversion has a significant effect on transcript abundance for hundreds of genes across the genome. Inversion affected loci (IAL) appear both within inversions as well as on unlinked chromosomes. Importantly, IAL do not appear to be influenced by the previously reported genome-wide expression correlation structure. We found that five genes involved with sterol uptake, four of which are Niemann-Pick Type 2 orthologs, are upregulated in flies with In(3R)Mo but do not have SNPs in LD with the inversion. We speculate that this upregulation is driven by genetic variation in mod(mdg4) that is in LD with In(3R)Mo. We find that there is little evidence for regional or position effect of inversions on gene expression at the chromosomal level but do find evidence for the distal breakpoint of In(3R)Mo interrupting one gene and possibly disassociating the two flanking genes from regulatory elements.}},

  abstract = {{Heritable variation in gene expression is common within species. Much of this variation is due to genetic changes at loci other than the affected gene and is thus trans-acting. This trans-regulatory variation is often polygenic, with individual variants typically having small effects, making the genetic architecture of trans-regulatory variation challenging to study. Consequently, key questions about trans-regulatory variation remain, including how selection affects this variation and how trans-regulatory variants are distributed throughout the genome and within species. Here, we show that trans-regulatory variation affecting TDH3 promoter activity is common among strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Comparing this variation to neutral models of trans-regulatory evolution based on empirical measures of mutational effects revealed that stabilizing selection has constrained this variation. Using a powerful quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping method, we identified \textbackslashtextasciitilde100 loci altering expression between a reference strain and each of three genetically distinct strains. In all three cases, the non-reference strain alleles increased and decreased TDH3 promoter activity with similar frequencies, suggesting that stabilizing selection maintained many trans-acting variants with opposing effects. Loci altering expression were located throughout the genome, with many loci being strain specific and others being shared among multiple strains. These findings are consistent with theory showing stabilizing selection for quantitative traits can maintain many alleles with opposing effects, and the wide-spread distribution of QTL throughout the genome is consistent with the omnigenic model of complex trait variation. Furthermore, the prevalence of alleles with opposing effects might provide raw material for compensatory evolution and developmental systems drift.}},

  abstract = {{Enhancers control the correct temporal and cell-type-specific activation of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes. Knowing their properties, regulatory activity and targets is crucial to understand the regulation of differentiation and homeostasis. Here we use the FANTOM5 panel of samples, covering the majority of human tissues and cell types, to produce an atlas of active, in vivo-transcribed enhancers. We show that enhancers share properties with CpG-poor messenger RNA promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced RNAs, the generation of which is strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedented depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and ubiquitous enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strength rather than expression patterns. The online FANTOM5 enhancer atlas represents a unique resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers and gene regulation. Using the FANTOM5 CAGE expression atlas, the authors show that bidirectional capped RNAs are a signature feature of active enhancers and identify over 40,000 enhancer candidates from over 800 human cell and tissue samples across the whole human body. FANTOM5 (standing for functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5) is the fifth major stage of a major international collaboration that aims to dissect the transcriptional regulatory networks that define every human cell type. Two Articles in this issue of Nature present some of the project's latest results. The first paper uses the FANTOM5 panel of tissue and primary cell samples to define an atlas of active, in vivo bidirectionally transcribed enhancers across the human body. These authors show that bidirectional capped RNAs are a signature feature of active enhancers and identify more than 40,000 enhancer candidates from over 800 human cell and tissue samples. The enhancer atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cell types and identify disease-associated regulatory SNPs, and will be a resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers. In the second paper, single-molecule sequencing is used to map human and mouse transcription start sites and their usage in a panel of distinct human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce the most comprehensive mammalian gene expression atlas to date. The data provide a plethora of insights into open reading frames and promoters across different cell types in addition to valuable annotation of mammalian cell-type-specific transcriptomes.}},

We combine known protein sizes, stabilities, and rates of folding and diffusion, with the known protein-length distributions P(N) of proteomes (Escherichia coli, yeast, and worm), to formulate distributions and scaling relationships in order to address questions of cell physics. Why do mesophilic cells die around 50 °C? How can the maximal growth-rate temperature (around 37 °C) occur so close to the cell-death temperature? The model shows that the cell's death temperature coincides with a denaturation catastrophe of its proteome. The reason cells can function so well just a few degrees below their death temperature is because proteome denaturation is so cooperative. Why are cells so dense-packed with protein molecules (about 20\% by volume)? Cells are packed at a density that maximizes biochemical reaction rates. At lower densities, proteins collide too rarely. At higher densities, proteins diffuse too slowly through the crowded cell. What limits cell sizes and growth rates? Cell growth is limited by rates of protein synthesis, by the folding rates of its slowest proteins, and--for large cells--by the rates of its protein diffusion. Useful insights into cell physics may be obtainable from scaling laws that encapsulate information from protein knowledge bases.}},

The emergence of gene expression differences between genetically identical cells is referred to as gene expression noise, the sources of which are not well understood. In this work, by studying gene expression noise between multiple cell lineages and mammalian species, we find consistent evidence of a role for CpG islands as sources of gene expression noise. Variation in noise among CpG island promoters can be partially attributed to differences in island size, in which short islands have noisier gene expression. Building on these findings, we investigate the potential for short CpG islands to act as fast response elements to environmental stimuli. Specifically, we find that these islands are enriched amongst primary response genes in SWI/SNF-independent stimuli, suggesting that expression noise is an indicator of promoter responsiveness. Thus, through the integration of single-cell RNA expression profiling, chromatin landscape and temporal gene expression dynamics, we have uncovered a role for short CpG island promoters as fast response elements.}},

  abstract = {{Gene co-expression networks capture biologically important patterns in gene expression data, enabling functional analyses of genes, discovery of biomarkers, and interpretation of regulatory genetic variants. Most network analyses to date have been limited to assessing correlation between total gene expression levels in a single or small sets of tissues. Here, we have reconstructed networks that capture a much more complete set of regulatory relationships, specifically including regulation of relative isoform abundance and splicing, and tissue-specific connections unique to each of a diverse set of tissues. Using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6 RNA-sequencing data across 44 tissues in 449 individuals, we evaluated shared and tissue-specific network relationships. First, we developed a framework called Transcriptome Wide Networks (TWNs) for combining total expression and relative isoform levels into a single sparse network, capturing the complex interplay between the regulation of splicing and transcription. We built TWNs for sixteen tissues, and found that hubs with isoform node neighbors in these networks were strongly enriched for splicing and RNA binding genes, demonstrating their utility in unraveling regulation of splicing in the human transcriptome, and providing a set of candidate shared and tissue-specific regulatory hub genes. Next, we used a Bayesian biclustering model that identifies network edges between genes with co-expression in a single tissue to reconstruct tissue-specific networks (TSNs) for 27 distinct GTEx tissues and for four subsets of related tissues. Using both TWNs and TSNs, we characterized gene co-expression patterns shared across tissues. Finally, we found genetic variants associated with multiple neighboring nodes in our networks, supporting the estimated network structures and identifying 33 genetic variants with distant regulatory impact on transcription and splicing. Our networks provide an improved understanding of the complex relationships between genes in the human transcriptome, including tissue-specificity of gene co-expression, regulation of splicing, and the coordinated impact of genetic variation on transcription.}},

We found that, in this 10 kb region, the distribution of variants depends on their frequency and on their localization relative to the TSS. We found that the distribution of variants is generally different for TSSs located inside or outside of CpG islands. We found a significant relationship between the distribution of rare variants and nucleosome occupancy scores. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that evolutionary (purifying selection) and nonevolutionary (biased gene conversion) forces both play a role in determining the relative SNP frequency around TSSs. Finally, we analyzed the potential pathogenicity of each class of variant using the Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion score. In conclusion, this study provides a novel and detailed view of the distribution of genomic variants around TSSs, providing insight into the forces that instigate and maintain variability in such critical regions.}},

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.

RESULTS:We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.

We have mapped Drosophila TGF-β signaling factors Mad, dSmad2, Medea, and Schnurri genome-wide in Kc cells and find that numerous sites for these factors overlap with the architectural protein CTCF. Depletion of CTCF by RNAi results in the disappearance of a subset of Smad sites, suggesting Smad proteins localize to CTCF binding sites in a CTCF-dependent manner. Sensitive Smad binding sites are enriched at low occupancy CTCF peaks within topological domains, rather than at the physical domain boundaries where CTCF may function as an insulator. In response to Decapentaplegic, CTCF binding is not significantly altered, whereas Mad, Medea, and Schnurri are redirected from CTCF to non-CTCF binding sites. These results suggest that CTCF participates in the recruitment of Smad proteins to a subset of genomic sites and in the redistribution of these proteins in response to BMP signaling.}},

  abstract = {{Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) integrate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression datasets to identify gene–trait associations. In this Perspective, we explore properties of TWAS as a potential approach to prioritize causal genes at GWAS loci, by using simulations and case studies of literature-curated candidate causal genes for schizophrenia, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and Crohn’s disease. We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some likely to be non-causal, owing to sharing of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization with expression data from non-trait-related tissues or cell types, owing to substantial cross-cell-type variation in expression levels and eQTL strengths. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes more accurately than simple baselines. We suggest best practices for causal-gene prioritization with TWAS and discuss future opportunities for improvement. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using eQTL datasets to determine causal genes at GWAS loci. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) prioritize candidate causal genes at GWAS loci. This Perspective discusses the challenges to TWAS analysis, caveats to interpretation of results and opportunities for improvements to this class of methods.}},

Here we suggest a formal perspective on the difficulty in finding such a unification, in the form of an impossibility theorem: for a set of three simple properties, we show that there is no clustering function satisfying all three. Relaxations of these properties expose some of the interesting (and unavoidable) trade-offs at work in well-studied clustering techniques such as single-linkage, sum-of-pairs, k-means, and k-median.}},

  doi = {10.1093/molbev/msw058}, 
  abstract = {{Experimental studies have found the involvement of certain conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in the regulation of the proximal protein-coding genes in mammals. However, reported cases of long range enhancer activities and inter-chromosomal regulation suggest that proximity of CNSs to protein-coding genes might not be important for regulation. To test the importance of the CNS genomic location, we extracted the CNSs conserved between chicken and four mammalian species (human, mouse, dog and cattle). These CNSs were confirmed to be under purifying selection. The intergenic CNSs are often found in clusters in gene deserts, where protein-coding genes are in paucity. The distribution pattern, ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data suggested that the CNSs are more likely to be regulatory elements and not corresponding to long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs). Physical distances between CNS and their nearest protein coding genes were well conserved between human and mouse genomes, and CNS-flanking genes were often found in evolutionarily conserved genomic neighborhoods. ChIP-Seq signal and gene expression patterns also suggested that CNSs regulate nearby genes. Interestingly, genes with more CNSs have more evolutionarily conserved expression than those with fewer CNSs. These computationally obtained results suggest that the genomic locations of CNSs are important for their regulatory functions. In fact, various kinds of evolutionary constraints may be acting to maintain the genomic locations of CNSs and protein-coding genes in mammals to ensure proper regulation.}},

  title = {{Temperature-Dependent Regulation of Upstream Open Reading Frame Translation in S. Cerevisiae}}, 
  doi = {10.1101/678409}, 
  abstract = {{<p>Background: Translation of an mRNA in eukaryotes starts at AUG in most cases. Near-cognate codons (NCCs) such as UUG, ACG and AUU are also used as start sites at low levels in S. cerevisiae. Initiation from NCCs or AUGs in the 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs can lead to translation of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that might regulate expression of the main ORF (mORF). Although there is some circumstantial evidence that the translation of uORFs can be affected by environmental conditions, little is known about how it is affected by changes in growth temperature. Results: Using reporter assays, we found that changes in growth temperature can affect translation from NCC start sites in yeast cells, suggesting the possibility that gene expression could be regulated by temperature by altering use of different uORF start codons. Using ribosome profiling, we provide evidence that growth temperature regulates the efficiency of translation of nearly 200 uORFs in S. cerevisiae. Of these uORFs, most that start with an AUG codon have increased translational efficiency at 37 °C relative to 30 °C and decreased efficiency at 20 °C. For translationally regulated uORFs starting with NCCs, we did not observe a general trend for the direction of regulation as a function of temperature, suggesting mRNA-specific features can determine the mode of temperature-dependent regulation. Consistent with this conclusion, the position of the uORFs in the 5′-leader relative to the 5′-cap and the start codon of the main ORF correlates with the direction of temperature-dependent regulation of uORF translation. We have identified several novel cases in which changes in uORF translation are inversely correlated with changes in the translational efficiency of the downstream main ORF. Our data suggest that translation of these mRNAs is subject to temperature-dependent, uORF-mediated regulation. Conclusions: Overall, our data suggest that alterations in the translation of specific uORFs by temperature can regulate gene expression in S. cerevisiae.</p>}},

  abstract = {{Gene transcription occurs in discontinuous bursts. Although bursts are conserved in all forms of life, the causes and implications of bursting are not clear. Here we delineate a specific cause of bursts and contextualize the significance of bursting, using analysis of a gene family encoding 17 identical actin proteins. Although the genes show similar developmental expression, which is coupled in single cells, they show strong differences in bursting dynamics. These distinct bursting patterns indicate that different signals regulate the individual genes and suggest expansion of the family may have allowed diversification of actin gene regulation. By exchanging the promoters of genes, we show that the dominant driver of bursting dynamics is the gene promoter, not the genome context. During the evolution of gene families, functional diversification of proteins often follows gene duplication. However, many gene families expand while preserving protein sequence. Why do cells maintain multiple copies of the same gene? Here we have addressed this question for an actin family with 17 genes encoding an identical protein. The genes have divergent flanking regions and are scattered throughout the genome. Surprisingly, almost the entire family showed similar developmental expression profiles, with their expression also strongly coupled in single cells. Using live cell imaging, we show that differences in gene expression were apparent over shorter timescales, with family members displaying different transcriptional bursting dynamics. Strong “bursty” behaviors contrasted steady, more continuous activity, indicating different regulatory inputs to individual actin genes. To determine the sources of these different dynamic behaviors, we reciprocally exchanged the upstream regulatory regions of gene family members. This revealed that dynamic transcriptional behavior is directly instructed by upstream sequence, rather than features specific to genomic context. A residual minor contribution of genomic context modulates the gene OFF rate. Our data suggest promoter diversification following gene duplication could expand the range of stimuli that regulate the expression of essential genes. These observations contextualize the significance of transcriptional bursting.}},

  abstract = {{Understanding how gene regulatory networks control the progressive restriction of cell fates is a long-standing challenge. Recent advances in measuring gene expression in single cells are providing new insights into lineage commitment. However, the regulatory events underlying these changes remain unclear. Here we investigate the dynamics of chromatin regulatory landscapes during embryogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq), we profiled chromatin accessibility in over 20,000 single nuclei from fixed Drosophila melanogaster embryos spanning three landmark embryonic stages: 2-4 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 5 blastoderm nuclei), when each embryo comprises around 6,000 multipotent cells; 6-8 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 10-11), to capture a midpoint in embryonic development when major lineages in the mesoderm and ectoderm are specified; and 10-12 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 13), when each of the embryo's more than 20,000 cells are undergoing terminal differentiation. Our results show that there is spatial heterogeneity in the accessibility of the regulatory genome before gastrulation, a feature that aligns with future cell fate, and that nuclei can be temporally ordered along developmental trajectories. During mid-embryogenesis, tissue granularity emerges such that individual cell types can be inferred by their chromatin accessibility while maintaining a signature of their germ layer of origin. Analysis of the data reveals overlapping usage of regulatory elements between cells of the endoderm and non-myogenic mesoderm, suggesting a common developmental program that is reminiscent of the mesendoderm lineage in other species. We identify 30,075 distal regulatory elements that exhibit tissue-specific accessibility. We validated the germ-layer specificity of a subset of these predicted enhancers in transgenic embryos, achieving an accuracy of 90\%. Overall, our results demonstrate the power of shotgun single-cell profiling of embryos to resolve dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape during development, and to uncover the cis-regulatory programs of metazoan germ layers and cell types.}},

Most research has focused on two extreme cases: crosses between closely related inbred lines, where hybrids are fitter than their parents, or crosses between effectively isolated species, where hybrids suffer severe breakdown. But many natural populations must fall into intermediate regimes, with multiple types of gene interaction, and these are more difficult to study. Here, we develop a simple fitness landscape model, and show that it naturally interpolates between previous modeling approaches, which were designed for the extreme cases, and invoke either mildly deleterious recessives, or discrete hybrid incompatibilities. Our model yields several new predictions, which we test with genomic data from Mytilus mussels, and published data from plants (Zea, Populus, and Senecio) and animals (Mus, Teleogryllus, and Drosophila). The predictions are generally supported, and the model explains a number of surprising empirical patterns. Our approach enables novel and complementary uses of genome‐wide datasets, which do not depend on identifying outlier loci, or “speciation genes” with anomalous effects. Given its simplicity and flexibility, and its predictive successes with a wide range of data, the approach should be readily extendable to other outstanding questions in the study of hybridization.}},

Analysis of the data resulting from these single-cell ‘omics approaches show: 1) the description of the ciliates in the class Karyorelictea as ‘primitive’ is inaccurate because their somatic macronuclei contain loci of varying copy number (i.e. they have been processed by genome rearrangements from the zygotic nucleus); 2) gene-sized somatic chromosomes exist in the class Litostomatea, consistent with Balbiani’s 1890 observation of giant chromosomes in this lineage; and 3) gene scrambling exists in the underexplored Postciliodesmatophora (the classes Heterotrichea and Karyorelictea, abbreviated here as the Po-clade), one of two major clades of ciliates.

However, the majority of discovery efforts are based on data from populations of European ancestry1–3. In light of the differential genetic architecture that is known to exist between populations, bias in representation can exacerbate existing disease and healthcare disparities. Critical variants may be missed if they have a low frequency or are completely absent in European populations, especially as the field shifts its attention towards rare variants, which are more likely to be population-specific4–10. Additionally, effect sizes and their derived risk prediction scores derived in one population may not accurately extrapolate to other populations11,12. Here we demonstrate the value of diverse, multi-ethnic participants in large-scale genomic studies. The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study conducted a GWAS of 26 clinical and behavioural phenotypes in 49,839 non-European individuals. Using strategies tailored for analysis of multi-ethnic and admixed populations, we describe a framework for analysing diverse populations, identify 27 novel loci and 38 secondary signals at known loci, as well as replicate 1,444 GWAS catalogue associations across these traits. Our data show evidence of effect-size heterogeneity across ancestries for published GWAS associations, substantial benefits for fine-mapping using diverse cohorts and insights into clinical implications. In the United States—where minority populations have a disproportionately higher burden of chronic conditions13—the lack of representation of diverse populations in genetic research will result in inequitable access to precision medicine for those with the highest burden of disease. We strongly advocate for continued, large genome-wide efforts in diverse populations to maximize genetic discovery and reduce health disparities.

We demonstrate that on the genome level a single CpG methylation can serve as a more accurate predictor of gene expression than an average promoter / gene body methylation. We define CpG traffic lights (CpG TL) as CpG dinucleotides with a significant correlation between methylation and expression of a gene nearby. CpG TL are enriched in all regulatory regions. Among all promoters, CpG TL are especially enriched in poised ones, suggesting involvement of DNA methylation in their regulation. Yet, binding of only a handful of transcription factors, such as NRF1, ETS, STAT and IRF-family members, could be regulated by direct methylation of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) or its close proximity. For the majority of TF, an alternative scenario is more likely: methylation and inactivation of the whole regulatory element indirectly represses functional TF binding with a CpG TL being a reliable marker of such inactivation. CpG TL provide a promising insight into mechanisms of enhancer activity and gene regulation linking methylation of single CpG to gene expression. CpG TL methylation can be used as reliable markers of enhancer activity and gene expression in applications, e.g. in clinic where measuring DNA methylation is easier compared to directly measuring gene expression due to more stable nature of DNA.}},

  abstract = {{<h2>Summary</h2><p>Organisms regulate gene expression through changes in the activity of transcription factors (TFs). In yeast, the response of genes to changes in TF activity is generally assumed to be encoded in the promoter. To directly test this assumption, we chose 42 genes and, for each, replaced the promoter with a synthetic inducible promoter and measured how protein expression changes as a function of TF activity. Most genes exhibited gene-specific TF dose-response curves not due to differences in mRNA stability, translation, or protein stability. Instead, most genes have an intrinsic ability to buffer the effects of promoter activity. This can be encoded in the open reading frame and the 3′ end of genes and can be implemented by both autoregulatory feedback and by titration of limiting <i>trans</i> regulators. We show experimentally and computationally that, when misexpression of a gene is deleterious, this buffering insulates cells from fitness defects due to misregulation.</p>}},

  abstract = {{Eukaryotic genomes are organized into domains of differing structure and activity. There is evidence that the domain organization of the genome regulates its activity, yet our understanding of domain properties and the factors that influence their formation is poor. Here we use chromatin state analyses in early embryos and L3 larvae to investigate genome domain organization and its regulation in C. elegans. At both stages we find that the genome is organized into extended chromatin domains of high or low gene activity defined by different subsets of states, and enriched for H3K36me3 or H3K27me3 respectively. The border regions between domains contain large intergenic regions and a high density of transcription factor binding, suggesting a role for transcription regulation in separating chromatin domains. Despite the differences in cell types, overall domain organization is remarkably similar in early embryos and L3 larvae, with conservation of 85\% of domain border positions. Most genes in high activity domains are expressed in the germ line and broadly across cell types, whereas low activity domains are enriched for genes that are developmentally regulated. We find that domains are regulated by the germ line H3K36 methyltransferase MES-4 and that border regions show striking remodeling of H3K27me1, supporting roles for H3K36 and H3K27 methylation in regulating domain structure. Our analyses of C. elegans chromatin domain structure show that genes are organized by type into domains that have differing modes of regulation.}},

These unique features are highly conserved in mouse and human cells, strongly indicating a functional role for m(1)A in promoting translation of methylated mRNA.}},

Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) can measure the activity of thousands of regulatory DNA sequences and their variants in a single experiment. With the increase in the number of MPRA datasets that are publically available, one can now develop functional-based models which, given a DNA sequence, predict its regulatory activity. Here we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of several MPRA datasets in a variety of cellular contexts. We first applied an ensemble of methods to accurately predict the MPRA output in each context, and observed that the most predictive features are consistent across data sets. We then demonstrate that predictive models trained in one cellular context can be used to accurately predict MPRA output in another, with mild loss of accuracy attributed to features that depend on the cell type. Finally, we study the extent to which MPRA can assist with the identification of genetic modifications that are associated with transcriptional changes to nearby genes. Our analysis provides insight into how MPRA data can be leveraged to highlight functional regulatory regions throughout the genome and can guide efficient design of future MPRA experiments.</p>}},

  doi = {10.1101/gr.196006.115}, 
  abstract = {{Recent advances enabled by the Hi-C technique have unraveled many principles of chromosomal folding that were subsequently linked to disease and gene regulation. In particular, Hi-C revealed that chromosomes of animals are organized into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), evolutionary conserved compact chromatin domains that influence gene expression. Mechanisms that underlie partitioning of the genome into TADs remain poorly understood. To explore principles of TAD folding in Drosophila melanogaster, we performed Hi-C and PolyA+ RNA-seq in four cell lines of various origins (S2, Kc167, DmBG3-c2, and OSC). Contrary to previous studies, we find that regions between TADs (i.e. the inter-TADs and TAD boundaries) in Drosophila are only weakly enriched with the insulator protein dCTCF, while another insulator protein Su(Hw) is preferentially present within TADs. However, Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes. Accordingly, we find that binding of insulator proteins dCTCF and Su(Hw) predicts TAD boundaries much worse than active chromatin marks do. Interestingly, inter-TADs correspond to decompacted interbands of polytene chromosomes, whereas TADs mostly correspond to densely packed bands. Collectively, our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin. We propose the mechanism of TAD self-assembly based on the ability of nucleosomes from inactive chromatin to aggregate, and lack of this ability in acetylated nucleosomal arrays. Finally, we test this hypothesis by polymer simulations, and find that TAD partitioning may be explained by different modes of inter-nucleosomal interactions for active and inactive chromatin.}},

This is reflected, for example, in a weak or absent correlation between promoter divergence and expression divergence between paralogs. However, an inability to predict may reflect an inability to accurately measure or employment of the wrong parameters. Here we address this issue through integration of two exceptional resources: ENCODE data on transcription factor binding and the FANTOM5 high-resolution expression atlas. Consistent with the notion that in eukaryotes most transcription factors are activating, the number of transcription factors binding a promoter is a strong predictor of expression breadth. In addition, evolutionarily young duplicates have fewer transcription factor binders and narrower expression. Nonetheless, we find several binders and cooperative sets that are disproportionately associated with broad expression, indicating that models more complex than simple correlations should hold more predictive power. Indeed, a machine learning approach improves fit to the data compared with a simple correlation. Machine learning could at best moderately predict tissue of expression of tissue specific genes. We find robust evidence that some expression parameters and paralog expression divergence are strongly predictable with knowledge of transcription factor binding repertoire. While some cooperative complexes can be identified, consistent with the notion that most eukaryotic transcription factors are activating, a simple predictor, the number of binding transcription factors found on a promoter, is a robust predictor of expression breadth.}},

  abstract = {{Regulated transcription controls the diversity, developmental pathways and spatial organization of the hundreds of cell types that make up a mammal. Using single-molecule cDNA sequencing, we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage in human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce a comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the human body. We find that few genes are truly ‘housekeeping’, whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed of several closely separated TSSs, with independent cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved. Promoter-based expression analysis reveals key transcription factors defining cell states and links them to binding-site motifs. The functions of identified novel transcripts can be predicted by coexpression and sample ontology enrichment analyses. The functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5 (FANTOM5) project provides comprehensive expression profiles and functional annotation of mammalian cell-type-specific transcriptomes with wide applications in biomedical research. A study from the FANTOM consortium using single-molecule cDNA sequencing of transcription start sites and their usage in human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues reveals insights into the specificity and diversity of transcription patterns across different mammalian cell types. FANTOM5 (standing for functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5) is the fifth major stage of a major international collaboration that aims to dissect the transcriptional regulatory networks that define every human cell type. Two Articles in this issue of Nature present some of the project's latest results. The first paper uses the FANTOM5 panel of tissue and primary cell samples to define an atlas of active, in vivo bidirectionally transcribed enhancers across the human body. These authors show that bidirectional capped RNAs are a signature feature of active enhancers and identify more than 40,000 enhancer candidates from over 800 human cell and tissue samples. The enhancer atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cell types and identify disease-associated regulatory SNPs, and will be a resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers. In the second paper, single-molecule sequencing is used to map human and mouse transcription start sites and their usage in a panel of distinct human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce the most comprehensive mammalian gene expression atlas to date. The data provide a plethora of insights into open reading frames and promoters across different cell types in addition to valuable annotation of mammalian cell-type-specific transcriptomes.}},

  abstract = {{The processing of RNA transcripts from mammalian genes occurs in proximity to their transcription. Here, we describe a phenomenon affecting thousands of genes that we call exon-mediated activation of transcription starts (EMATS), in which the splicing of internal exons impacts promoter choice and the expression level of the gene. We observed that evolutionary gain of internal exons is associated with gain of new transcription start sites (TSSs) nearby and increased gene expression. Inhibiting exon splicing reduced transcription from nearby promoters, and creation of new spliced exons activated transcription from cryptic promoters. The strongest effects occurred for weak promoters located proximal and upstream of efficiently spliced exons. Together, our findings support a model in which splicing recruits transcription machinery locally to influence TSS choice and identify exon gain, loss, and regulatory change as major contributors to the evolution of alternative promoters and gene expression in mammals.}},

  abstract = {{Classical evolutionary theory maintains that mutation rate variation between genes should be random with respect to fitness and evolutionary optimization of genic mutation rates remains controversial. However, it has now become known that cytogenetic (DNA sequence + epigenomic) features influence local mutation probabilities, which is predicted by more recent theory to be a prerequisite for beneficial mutation rates between different classes of genes to readily evolve. To test this possibility, we used de novo mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana to create a high resolution predictive model of mutation rates as a function of cytogenetic features across the genome. As expected, mutation rates are significantly predicted by features such as GC content, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility. Deeper analyses of predicted mutation rates reveal effects of introns and untranslated exon regions in distancing coding sequences from mutational hotspots at the start and end of transcribed regions in A. thaliana . Finally, predicted coding region mutation rates are significantly lower in genes where mutations are more likely to be deleterious, supported by numerous estimates of evolutionary and functional constraint. These findings contradict neutral expectations that mutation probabilities are independent of fitness consequences. Instead they are consistent with the evolution of lower mutation rates in functionally constrained loci due to cytogenetic features, with important implications for evolutionary biology. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.}},

  abstract = {{Of the four known globin genes that exist in the fresh-water crustacean Daphnia magna, several are individually induced by hypoxia, lending pale normoxic animals a visible red color when challenged by oxygen deprivation. The promoter regions of the Daphnia globin genes each contain numerous hypoxia response elements (HREs) as potential binding sites for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Daphnia HIF, bound to human HRE sequences, was detected in extracts from hypoxic (red), but not normoxic (pale), animals. Taking advantage of the phylogenetically conserved HIF/HRE recognition, we employed heterologous transfections of HIF-expressing human and Drosophila cells to model HIF signaling in Daphnia. These experiments revealed that three functional HREs within the promoter of the D. magna globin-2 gene cooperate for maximal hypoxic induction of a downstream luciferase reporter gene. Two of these three cis-elements, at promoter positions -258 and -107, are able to specifically bind human, Drosophila, or Daphnia HIF complexes in vitro. The same two sites are also necessary for maximal induction of reporter transcription under low oxygen tension in the presence of either endogenous human or overexpressed Drosophila HIF proteins. The third motif of the globin-2 gene promoter, a CACGTG palindrome at position -146, functions as a docking site for an unknown constitutive transcription factor. In human cells, this -146 complex interferes with HIF occupancy at the adjacent -107 HRE and thus controls the extent of HIF-mediated hypoxic activation of the downstream target.}},

It is becoming increasingly evident that they also constitute prime target elements through which diversity and flexibility in the complex patterns of gene expression in multicellular organisms are created. The use of multiple promoters and transcription start sites is apparently a frequently used mechanism, whereas at the same time there is considerable variation and complexity in the patterns of alternative promoter usage. This review discusses the use of alternative promoters as a versatile mechanism to create diversity and flexibility in the regulation of gene expression. Alternative promoter usage can influence gene expression in very diverse ways. The level of transcription initiation can vary between alternative promoters, the turnover or translation efficiency of mRNA isoforms with different leader exons can differ, alternative promoters can have different tissue specificity and react differently to some signals, and finally, alternative promoter usage can lead to the generation of protein isoforms differing at the amino terminus.}},

We apply our approach to transcriptional regulation, an intermediate between genetic variation and complex disease. Using whole-genome DNA and lymphoblastoid cell line RNA sequencing data from 360 European individuals, we conservatively estimate that singletons contribute approximately 25\% of cis heritability across genes (dwarfing the contributions of other frequencies). The majority (approximately 76\%) of singleton heritability derives from ultrarare variants absent from thousands of additional samples.

Although modern methods profile DNA methylation at single CpG sites, methylation levels are usually averaged over genomic regions in the downstream analyses. In this study we demonstrate that single CpG methylation can serve as a more accurate predictor of gene expression compared to average promoter / gene body methylation. CpG positions with significant correlation between methylation and expression of a gene nearby (called CpG traffic lights) are evolutionary conserved and enriched for exact TSS positions and active enhancers. Among all promoter types, CpG traffic lights are especially enriched in poised promoters. Genes that harbor CpG traffic lights are associated with development and signal transduction. Methylation levels of individual CpG traffic lights vary between cell types dramatically with the increased frequency of intermediate methylation levels, indicating cell population heterogeneity in CpG methylation levels Being in line with the concept of the inherited stochastic epigenetic variation, methylation of such CpG positions might contribute to transcriptional regulation. Alternatively, one can hypothesize that traffic lights are markers of absent gene expression resulting from inactivation of their regulatory elements. In any case, CpG traffic light mechanism provide a promising insight into enhancer activity and gene expression, important from both fundamental and practical points of view.}},

By using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE), we mapped transcription initiation events at single nucleotide resolution across 12 stages of zebrafish development. These CAGE-based transcriptome maps reveal genome-wide rules of core promoter usage, structure, and dynamics, key to understanding the control of gene regulation during vertebrate ontogeny. They revealed the existence of multiple classes of pervasive intra- and intergenic post-transcriptionally processed RNA products and their developmental dynamics. Among these RNAs, we report splice donor site-associated intronic RNA (sRNA) to be specific to genes of the splicing machinery. For the identification of conserved features, we compared the zebrafish data sets to the first CAGE promoter map of Tetraodon and the existing human CAGE data. We show that a number of features, such as promoter type, newly discovered promoter properties such as a specialized purine-rich initiator motif, as well as sRNAs and the genes in which they are detected, are conserved in mammalian and Tetraodon CAGE-defined promoter maps.

CNEs exhibit extreme levels of sequence conservation of unexplained origin, with many acting as long-range enhancers during development. Clusters of CNEs, termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), define the span of regulatory interactions for many important developmental regulators. The function and genomic distribution of these elements close to important regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to the 3D conformation of these loci. We show that GRBs, defined using clusters of CNEs, coincide strongly with the patterns of topological organisation in metazoan genomes, predicting the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) at hundreds of loci. The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of non-coding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs called in chromosomal regions devoid of extreme non-coding conservation. The correspondence between GRBs and TADs suggests that TADs around developmental genes are ancient, slowly evolving genomic structures, many of which have had conserved spans for hundreds of millions of years. This relationship also explains the difference in TAD numbers and sizes between genomes. While the close correspondence between extreme conservation and the boundaries of this subset of TADs does not reveal the mechanism leading to the conservation of these elements, it provides a functional framework for studying the role of TADs in long-range transcriptional regulation.}},

Although polysome association is a critical step in translation, whether polysome selectively uses TSSs and core promoters and how this could impact translation remains elusive. In this study, we used CAGE followed by deep sequencing to globally profile the transcript 5′ isoforms in the translatome and transcriptome of human HEK293 cells at single-nucleotide resolution. By comparing the two profiles, we identified the 5′ isoforms preferentially used in translatome and revealed a widespread selective usage of TSSs (32.0\%) and core promoters (48.7\%) by polysome. We discovered the transcription initiation patterns and the sequence characteristics that were highly correlated with polysome selection. We further identified 5804 genes significantly enriched or depleted in translatome and showed that polysome selection was an important contributing factor to the abundance of related gene products. Moreover, after comparison with public transcriptome CAGE data from 180 human tissues and primary cells, we raised a question on whether it is a widely adopted mechanism to regulate translation efficiency by changing the transcription initiation sites on the transcription level in cells of different conditions. Using HEK293 cells as a model, we delineated an indirect selection toward TSSs and core promoters by the translation machinery. Our findings lend additional evidence for a much closer coordination between transcription and translation, warranting future translatome studies in more cell types and conditions to develop a more intricate regulatory model for gene expression.}},

This growing commitment to open science should be applauded and encouraged, especially when it occurs voluntarily and prior to peer review. Thanks to other researchers9 dedication to open science, we have had the privilege of conducting a reanalysis of a landmark experiment published as a preprint with data made available in a public repository. The study in question found that promoter DNA methylation is frequently insufficient to induce transcriptional repression, which appears to contradict a large body of observational studies showing a strong association between DNA methylation and gene expression. This study was the first to evaluate whether forcibly methylating thousands of DNA promoter regions is sufficient to suppress gene expression. The authors9 data analysis did not find a strong relationship between promoter methylation and transcriptional repression. However, their analyses did not make full use of statistical inference and applied a normalization technique that removes global differences that are representative of the actual biological system. Here we reanalyze the data with an approach that includes statistical inference of differentially methylated regions, as well as a normalization technique that accounts for global expression differences. We find that forced DNA methylation of thousands of promoters overwhelmingly represses gene expression. In addition, we show that complementary epigenetic marks of active transcription are reduced as a result of DNA methylation. Finally, by studying whether these associations are sensitive to the CG density of promoters, we find no substantial differences in the association between promoters with and without a CG island.

  abstract = {{Polycistronic mRNAs transcribed from operons are resolved via the trans-splicing of a spliced-leader (SL) RNA. Trans-splicing also occurs at monocistronic transcripts. The phlyogenetically sporadic appearance of trans-splicing and operons has made the driving force(s) for their evolution in metazoans unclear. Previous work has proposed that germline expression drives operon organization in Caenorhabditis elegans, and a recent hypothesis proposes that operons provide an evolutionary advantage via the conservation of transcriptional machinery during recovery from growth arrested states. Using a modified cap analysis of gene expression protocol we mapped sites of SL trans-splicing genome-wide in the marine chordate Oikopleura dioica. Tiled microarrays revealed the expression dynamics of trans-spliced genes across development and during recovery from growth arrest. Operons did not facilitate recovery from growth arrest in O. dioica. Instead, we found that trans-spliced transcripts were predominantly maternal. We then analyzed data from C. elegans and Ciona intestinalis and found that an enrichment of trans-splicing and operon gene expression in maternal mRNA is shared between all three species, suggesting that this may be a driving force for operon evolution in metazoans. Furthermore, we found that the majority of known terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs are trans-spliced in O. dioica and that the SL contains a TOP-like motif. This suggests that the SL in O. dioica confers nutrient-dependent translational control to trans-spliced mRNAs via the TOR-signaling pathway. We hypothesize that SL-trans-splicing provides an evolutionary advantage in species that depend on translational control for regulating early embryogenesis, growth and oocyte production in response to nutrient levels.}},

  abstract = {{<p>Transcription initiates at both coding and non-coding genomic elements, including mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) core promoters and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, each class has different expression profiles with lncRNAs and eRNAs being the most tissue-specific. How these complex differences in expression profiles and tissue-specificities are encoded in a single DNA sequence, however, remains unresolved. Here, we address this question using computational approaches and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) surveying hundreds of promoters and enhancers. We find that both divergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters have higher capacities to drive transcription than non-divergent lncRNA and mRNA core promoters, respectively. Conversely, lincRNAs and eRNAs have lower capacities to drive transcription and are more tissue-specific than divergent genes. This higher tissue-specificity is strongly associated with having less complex TF motif profiles at the core promoter. We experimentally validated these findings by testing both engineered single-nucleotide deletions and human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MPRA. In both cases, we observe that single nucleotides associated with many motifs are important drivers of promoter activity. Thus, we suggest that high TF motif density serves as a robust mechanism to increase promoter activity at the expense of tissue-specificity. Moreover, we find that 22\% of common SNPs in core promoter regions have significant regulatory effects. Collectively, our findings show that high TF motif density provides redundancy and increases promoter activity at the expense of tissue specificity, suggesting that specificity of expression may be regulated by simplicity of motif usage.</p>}},

Methods based on aggregating the statistics of many single loci into an allele frequency spectrum (AFS) have proven powerful, but such methods ignore potentially informative patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between neighboring loci. To leverage such patterns, we developed a composite-likelihood framework for inferring demographic history from aggregated statistics of pairs of loci. Using this framework, we show that two-locus statistics are indeed more sensitive to demographic history than single-locus statistics such as the AFS. In particular, two-locus statistics escape the notorious confounding of depth and duration of a bottleneck, and they provide a means to estimate effective population size based on the recombination rather than mutation rate. We applied our approach to a Zambian population of Drosophila melanogaster. Notably, using both single- and two-locus statistics, we found substantially lower estimates of effective population size than previous works. Together, our results demonstrate the broad potential for two-locus statistics to enable powerful population genetic inference.}},

Here we introduce a simple method for estimating relative RNA half-lives that is based on two standard and widely available high-throughput assays: Precision Run-On and sequencing (PRO-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Our method treats PRO-seq as a measure of transcription rate and RNA-seq as a measure of RNA concentration, and estimates the rate of RNA degradation required for a steady-state equilibrium. We show that this approach can be used to assay relative RNA half-lives genome-wide, with reasonable accuracy and good sensitivity for both coding and noncoding transcription units. Using a structural equation model (SEM), we test several features of transcription units, nearby DNA sequences, and nearby epigenomic marks for associations with RNA stability after controlling for their effects on transcription. We find that RNA splicing-related features, including intron length, are positively correlated with RNA stability, whereas features related to miRNA binding, DNA methylation, and G+C-richness are negatively correlated with RNA stability. Furthermore, we find that a measure of predicted stability based on U1 binding sites and polyadenylation sites distinguishes between unstable noncoding and stable coding transcripts but is not predictive of relative stability within the mRNA or lincRNA classes. We also identify several histone modifications that are associated with RNA stability after controlling for their correlations with transcription.

We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects.

It is unclear how many cis-regulatory elements exist, where these elements lie relative to promoters, and how these features are conserved across plant species.

Despite 10-fold variation in intergenic space among species, the majority of open chromatin regions lie within 3 kb upstream of a transcription start site in all species. We find a common set of four TFs that appear to regulate conserved gene sets in the root tips of all four species, suggesting that TF-gene networks are generally conserved. Comparative ATAC-seq profiling of Arabidopsis root hair and non-hair cell types revealed extensive similarity as well as many cell type-specific differences. Analyzing TF binding sites in differentially accessible regions identified a MYB-driven regulatory module unique to the hair cell, which appears to control both cell fate regulators and abiotic stress responses.

We report that NF-Y maintains the region upstream of TSSs in a nucleosome-depleted state while simultaneously protecting this accessible region against aberrant and/or ectopic transcription initiation. We find that loss of NF-Y binding in mammalian cells disrupts the promoter chromatin landscape, leading to nucleosomal encroachment over the canonical TSS. Importantly, this chromatin rearrangement is accompanied by upstream relocation of the transcription preinitiation complex and ectopic transcription initiation. Further, this phenomenon generates aberrant extended transcripts that undergo translation, disrupting gene expression profiles. These results establish NF-Y as a central player in TSS selection in metazoans and highlight the deleterious consequences of inaccurate transcription initiation.}},

Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.}},

However, the potential of APA in determining crop agronomic traits remains elusive. This study systematically tallied poly(A) sites of 14 different rice tissues and developmental stages using the Poly(A) Tag Sequencing (PAT-Seq) approach. The results indicate significant involvement of APA in developmental and quantitative trait loci (QTL) gene expression. About 48\% of all expressed genes use APA to generate transcriptomic and proteomic diversity. Some genes switch APA sites allowing differentially expressed genes to use alternate 3' UTR. Interestingly, APA in mature pollen are distinct where differential expression level of a set of poly(A) factors and different distribution of APA sites were found, indicating a unique mRNA 3'-end formation regulation during gametophyte development. Equally interesting, statistical analyses showed that QTL tends to use APA for regulation of gene expression of many agronomic traits, suggesting a potential important role of APA in rice production. These results provide thus far the most comprehensive and high-resolution resource for advanced analysis of APA in crops, and shed light on how APA are associated with trait formation in eukaryotes.}},

Here we show that RNA velocity—the time derivative of the gene expression state—can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain. We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.}},

Technologies such as Synthetic long-read RNA sequencing (SLR-RNA-seq) delivered five million isoforms and allowed assessing splicing coordination. Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore increase throughput also but require high input amounts or amplification. Our new droplet-based method, sparse isoform sequencing (spISO-seq), sequences 100k-200k partitions of 10-200 molecules at a time, enabling analysis of 10-100 million RNA molecules. SpISO-seq requires less than 1ng of input cDNA, limiting or removing the need for prior amplification with its associated biases. Adjusting the number of reads devoted to each molecule reduces sequencing lanes and cost, with little loss in detection power. The increased number of molecules expands our understanding of isoform complexity. In addition to confirming our previously published cases of splicing coordination (e.g. BIN1), the greater depth reveals many new cases such as MAPT. Coordination of internal exons is found to be extensive among protein coding genes: 23.5\%-59.3\% (95\% confidence interval) of highly expressed genes with distant alternative exons exhibit coordination, showcasing the need for long-read transcriptomics. However, coordination is less frequent for non-coding sequences suggesting a larger role of splicing coordination in shaping proteins. Groups of genes with coordination are involved in protein-protein interactions with each other, raising the possibility that coordination facilitates complex formation and/or function. We also find new splicing coordination types, involving initial and terminal exons. Our results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the human transcriptome and a general, cost effective method to analyze it.}},

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process has long been a goal of research on basidiomycetes. Large scale assessment of the expressed transcriptomes of these developmental stages will facilitate the generation of a more comprehensive picture of the mushroom fruiting process. In this study, we coupled 5'-Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (5'-SAGE) to high-throughput pyrosequencing from 454 Life Sciences to analyze the transcriptomes and identify up-regulated genes among vegetative mycelium (Myc) and stage 1 primordium (S1-Pri) of Coprinopsis cinerea during fruiting body development. We evaluated the expression of >3,000 genes in the two respective growth stages and discovered that almost one-third of these genes were preferentially expressed in either stage. This identified a significant turnover of the transcriptome during the course of fruiting body development. Additionally, we annotated more than 79,000 transcription start sites (TSSs) based on the transcriptomes of the mycelium and stage 1 primoridum stages. Patterns of enrichment based on gene annotations from the GO and KEGG databases indicated that various structural and functional protein families were uniquely employed in either stage and that during primordial growth, cellular metabolism is highly up-regulated. Various signaling pathways such as the cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways were also identified as up-regulated, consistent with the model that sensing of nutrient levels and the environment are important in this developmental transition. More than 100 up-regulated genes were also found to be unique to mushroom forming basidiomycetes, highlighting the novelty of fruiting body development in the fungal kingdom. We implicated a wealth of new candidate genes important to early stages of mushroom fruiting development, though their precise molecular functions and biological roles are not yet fully known. This study serves to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fruiting body development in the model mushroom C. cinerea.}},

Although sponge enhancers, which are present in both highly conserved syntenic gene regions ( Islet–Scaper, Ccne1–Uri and Tdrd3–Diaph3 ) and sponge-specific intergenic regions, have no significant sequence identity with vertebrate genomic sequences, the type and frequency of TF binding motifs in the sponge enhancer allow for the identification of homologous enhancers in bilaterians. Islet enhancers identified in human and mouse Scaper genes drive zebrafish reporter expression patterns that are almost identical to the sponge Islet enhancer. The existence of homologous enhancers in these disparate metazoans suggests animal development is controlled by TF-enhancer DNA interactions that were present in the first multicellular animals.

Because there are several analogies between the regulation of protein functions by kinases and the regulation of gene expression by transcription factors, the principles that guide transcriptional regulatory evolution can also be explored in kinase–substrate networks.

We find that (1) tandem gene duplication has generated ∼80\% of the nascent duplicates that are limited to single species (D. melanogaster or Drosophila yakuba); (2) the most abundant new genes shared by multiple species (44.1\%) are dispersed duplicates, and are more likely to be retained and be functional; (3) de novo gene origination from noncoding sequences plays an unexpectedly important role during the origin of new genes, and is responsible for 11.9\% of the new genes; (4) retroposition is also an important mechanism, and had generated ∼10\% of the new genes; (5) ∼30\% of the new genes in the D. melanogaster species complex recruited various genomic sequences and formed chimeric gene structures, suggesting structure innovation as an important way to help fixation of new genes; and (6) the rate of the origin of new functional genes is estimated to be five to 11 genes per million years in the D. melanogaster subgroup. Finally, we survey gene frequencies among 19 globally derived strains for D. melanogaster-specific new genes and reveal that 44.4\% of them show copy number polymorphisms within a population. In conclusion, we provide a panoramic picture for the origin of new genes in Drosophila species.}},

Segregation of parental histones to the leading strand increased markedly in cells with histone-binding mutations in MCM2, part of the replicative helicase, exacerbating histone PTM sister chromatid asymmetry.

Here, we present FFPEcap-seq, a method specifically designed for sequencing capped 5′ ends of RNA derived from FFPE samples. FFPEcap-seq combines enzymatic enrichment of 5′ capped RNAs with template switching to create sequencing libraries. We find that FFPEcap-seq can faithfully capture mRNA expression levels in FFPE specimens while also detecting enhancer RNAs that arise from distal regulatory regions. FFPEcap-seq is a fast and straightforward method for making high-quality 5′ end RNA-seq libraries from FFPE-derived RNA.}},

We apply GoT to profile 38,290 CD34+ cells from patients with CALR-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms to study how somatic mutations corrupt the complex process of human haematopoiesis. High-resolution mapping of malignant versus normal haematopoietic progenitors revealed an increasing fitness advantage with myeloid differentiation of cells with mutated CALR. We identified the unfolded protein response as a predominant outcome of CALR mutations, with a considerable dependency on cell identity, as well as upregulation of the NF-κB pathway specifically in uncommitted stem cells. We further extended the GoT toolkit to genotype multiple targets and loci that are distant from transcript ends. Together, these findings reveal that the transcriptional output of somatic mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms is dependent on the native cell identity. Profiling of over 38,000 CD34+ cells from patients with CALR-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms, using the ‘Genotyping of Transcriptomes’ procedure, reveals that the transcriptional output of these mutations depends upon native cell identity.}},

Using two complementary techniques of multiplex enhancer-reporter assays, we discovered that functional enhancers could be discriminated from non-functional binding events by the occurrence of a single TP53 canonical motif. By combining machine learning with a meta-analysis of TP53 ChIP-seq data sets we identified a core set of more than one thousand responsive enhancers in the human genome. This TP53 cistrome is invariably used between cell types and experimental conditions, while differences between experiments can be attributed to indirect non-functional binding events.

Here we describe similarity regression, a significantly improved method for predicting motifs, which we use to update and expand the Cis-BP database. Similarity regression inherently quantifies TF motif evolution, and shows that previous claims of near-complete conservation of motifs between human and Drosophila are inflated, with nearly half of the motifs in each species absent from the other, largely due to extensive divergence in C2H2 zinc finger proteins.

However, the sources of most regulatory genetic variation remain unknown. Here, we used transcriptome profiling in 1,012 yeast segregants to map the genetic basis of variation in gene expression with high statistical power. We identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that together account for over 70\% of the total genetic contribution to variation in mRNA levels, allowing us to examine the sources of regulatory variation comprehensively. We found that variation in the expression of a typical gene has a complex genetic architecture involving multiple eQTL. We also detected hundreds of eQTL pairs with significant non-additive interactions in an unbiased genome-wide scan. Although most genes were influenced by a local eQTL located close to the gene, most expression variation arose from distant, trans-acting eQTL located far from their target genes. Nearly all distant eQTL clustered at 102 "hotspot" locations, some of which influenced the expression of thousands of genes. Hotspot regions were enriched for transcription factor genes and altered expression of their target genes though both direct and indirect mechanisms. Many local eQTL had no detectable effects on the expression of other genes in trans. These results reveal the complexity of genetic influences on transcriptome variation in unprecedented depth and detail.</p>}},

To examine the genetic architecture of regulatory variation in Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed genome-wide association (GWA) mapping of gene expression in an F(1) hybrid diversity panel. At a genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.2, an associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) explains >38\% of trait variation. In comparison with SNPs that are distant from the genes to which they were associated, locally associated SNPs are preferentially found in regions with extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) and have distinct population frequencies of the derived alleles (where Arabidopsis lyrata has the ancestral allele), suggesting that different selective forces are acting. Locally associated SNPs tend to have additive inheritance, whereas distantly associated SNPs are primarily dominant. In contrast to results from mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in linkage studies, we observe extensive allelic heterogeneity for local regulatory loci in our diversity panel. By association mapping of allele-specific expression (ASE), we detect a significant enrichment for cis-acting variation in local regulatory variation. In addition to gene expression variation, association mapping of splicing variation reveals both local and distant genetic regulation for intron and exon level traits. Finally, we identify candidate genes for 59 diverse phenotypic traits that were mapped to eQTL.}},

Existing models suggest that RNA polymerases I and III (Pol I and Pol III) are the only enzymes that directly mediate the expression of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) components of ribosomes. Here we show, however, that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) inside human nucleoli operates near genes encoding rRNAs to drive their expression. Pol II, assisted by the neurodegeneration-associated enzyme senataxin, generates a shield comprising triplex nucleic acid structures known as R-loops at intergenic spacers flanking nucleolar rRNA genes. The shield prevents Pol I from producing sense intergenic noncoding RNAs (sincRNAs) that can disrupt nucleolar organization and rRNA expression. These disruptive sincRNAs can be unleashed by Pol II inhibition, senataxin loss, Ewing sarcoma or locus-associated R-loop repression through an experimental system involving the proteins RNaseH1, eGFP and dCas9 (which we refer to as ‘red laser’). We reveal a nucleolar Pol-II-dependent mechanism that drives ribosome biogenesis, identify disease-associated disruption of nucleoli by noncoding RNAs, and establish locus-targeted R-loop modulation. Our findings revise theories of labour division between the major RNA polymerases, and identify nucleolar Pol II as a major factor in protein synthesis and nuclear organization, with potential implications for health and disease. RNA polymerase II has an unexpected function in the nucleolus, helping to drive the expression of ribosomal RNA and to protect nucleolar structure through a mechanism involving triplex R-loop structures.}},

The model also predicts an unfavorable homotypic interaction between TFs, helping to explain the observation that homotypic chains of binding sites express at low levels. We further investigated the expression driven by CREs comprised of homotypic chains of KLF4 binding sites. Our results suggest that KLF homologs make unique contributions to regulation by these CREs.

Using yeast as a model, we find that heteromerization is frequent among duplicated homomers and correlates with functional similarity between paralogs. Using in silico evolution, we show that for homomers and heteromers sharing binding interfaces, mutations in one paralog can have structural pleiotropic effects on both interactions, resulting in highly correlated responses of the complexes to selection. Therefore, heteromerization could be preserved indirectly due to selection for the maintenance of homomers, thus slowing down functional divergence between paralogs. We suggest that paralogs can overcome the obstacle of structural pleiotropy by regulatory evolution at the transcriptional and post-translational levels.}},

Despite the large evolutionary scale, the presence of duplicated highly conserved non-coding regions provided unambiguous proof for this scenario for dozens of ancient GRBs.

The cis-regulatory elements that control gene expression reside in noncoding regions and can be identified by mapping the binding sites of tissue-specific transcription factors. Cone-rod homeobox (CRX) is a key transcription factor in photoreceptor differentiation and survival, but its in vivo targets are largely unknown. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) on CRX to identify thousands of cis-regulatory regions around photoreceptor genes in adult mouse retina. CRX directly regulates downstream photoreceptor transcription factors and their target genes via a network of spatially distributed regulatory elements around each locus. CRX-bound regions act in a synergistic fashion to activate transcription and contain multiple CRX binding sites which interact in a spacing- and orientation-dependent manner to fine-tune transcript levels. CRX ChIP-seq was also performed on Nrl(-/-) retinas, which represent an enriched source of cone photoreceptors. Comparison with the wild-type ChIP-seq data set identified numerous rod- and cone-specific CRX-bound regions as well as many shared elements. Thus, CRX combinatorially orchestrates the transcriptional networks of both rods and cones by coordinating the expression of photoreceptor genes including most retinal disease genes. In addition, this study pinpoints thousands of noncoding regions of relevance to both Mendelian and complex retinal disease.}},

The function of these factors appears to be highly conserved among species based on mutant phenotypes. However, the conservation of their downstream processes is much less well understood, mostly because the evolutionary turnover and variation of their DNA-binding sites (BS) among plant species has not yet been experimentally determined.Here, we performed comparative ChIP-seq experiments of the MADS-domain transcription factor SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) in two closely related Arabidopsis species: A. thaliana and A. lyrata which have very similar floral organ morphology. We found that binding site conservation is associated with DNA sequence conservation, the presence of the CArG-box BS motif and on the relative position of the BS to its potential target gene. Differences in genome size and structure can explain that SEP3 BSs in A. lyrata can be located more distantly to their potential target genes than their counterparts in A. thaliana. In A. lyrata, we identified transposition as a mechanism to generate novel SEP3 binding locations in the genome. Comparative gene expression analysis shows that the loss/gain of BSs is associated with a change in gene expression. In summary, this study investigates the evolutionary dynamics of DNA BSs of a floral key-regulatory transcription factor, and explores factors affecting this phenomenon.}},

Multiple complementary methods have been developed to quantitatively track nascent transcription genome-wide at nucleotide resolution, all of which have contributed novel insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and transcription-coupled RNA processing. Here we critically evaluate the array of strategies used for investigating nascent transcription and discuss the recent conceptual advances they have provided.

However, the mechanistic links between genetic variation and methylation remain unclear. To begin addressing this gap, we collected methylation data at ∼300,000 loci in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 64 HapMap Yoruba individuals, and genome-wide bisulfite sequence data in ten of these individuals. We identified (at an FDR of 10\%) 13,915 cis methylation QTLs (meQTLs)—i.e., CpG sites in which changes in DNA methylation are associated with genetic variation at proximal loci. We found that meQTLs are frequently associated with changes in methylation at multiple CpGs across regions of up to 3 kb. Interestingly, meQTLs are also frequently associated with variation in other properties of gene regulation, including histone modifications, DNase I accessibility, chromatin accessibility, and expression levels of nearby genes. These observations suggest that genetic variants may lead to coordinated molecular changes in all of these regulatory phenotypes. One plausible driver of coordinated changes in different regulatory mechanisms is variation in transcription factor (TF) binding. Indeed, we found that SNPs that change predicted TF binding affinities are significantly enriched for associations with DNA methylation at nearby CpGs.}},

Diverse transcript isoforms arise from the use of alternative transcription start sites, polyadenylation sites and splice sites; however, the relative contribution of these processes to isoform diversity in normal human physiology is unclear. To address this question, we investigated cell type-dependent differences in exon usage of over 18 000 protein-coding genes in 23 cell types from 798 samples of the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project. We found that about half of the expressed genes displayed tissue-dependent transcript isoforms. Alternative transcription start and termination sites, rather than alternative splicing, accounted for the majority of tissue-dependent exon usage. We confirmed the widespread tissue-dependent use of alternative transcription start sites in a second, independent dataset, Cap Analysis of Gene Expression data from the FANTOM consortium. Moreover, our results indicate that most tissue-dependent splicing involves untranslated exons and therefore may not increase proteome complexity. Thus, alternative transcription start and termination sites are the principal drivers of transcript isoform diversity across tissues, and may underlie the majority of cell type specific proteomes and functions.}},

In obligately sexual organisms, meiotic recombination is the dominant force separating linked variants from one another, and thus in determining the decay of linkage disequilibrium with physical distance. In facultatively sexual diploid organisms that principally reproduce clonally, mechanisms of mitotic exchange are expected to become relatively more important in shaping linkage disequilibrium. Here we outline mathematical and computational models of a facultative-sex coalescent process that includes meiotic and mitotic recombination, via both crossovers and gene conversion, to determine how linkage disequilibrium is affected with facultative sex. We demonstrate that the degree to which linkage disequilibrium is broken down by meiotic recombination simply scales with the probability of sex if it is sufficiently high (much greater than for population size N). However, with very rare sex (occurring with frequency on the order of ), mitotic gene conversion plays a particularly important and complicated role because it both breaks down associations between sites and removes within-individual diversity. Strong population structure under rare sex leads to lower average linkage disequilibrium values than in panmictic populations, due to the influence of low-frequency polymorphisms created by allelic sequence divergence acting in individual subpopulations. These analyses provide information on how to interpret observed linkage disequilibrium patterns in facultative sexuals and to determine what genomic forces are likely to shape them.}},

This is due to the facts that different types of promoters may share quite similar consensus sequence pattern, and that the promoters of same type may have considerably different consensus sequences.Results: To overcome such difficulty, using the multi-window-based PseKNC (pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition) approach to incorporate the short-, middle-, and long-range sequence information, we have developed a two-layer seamless predictor named as “iPromoter-2L”. The 1st layer serves to identify a query DNA sequence as a promoter or non-promoter, and the 2nd layer to predict which of the following six types the identified promoter belongs to: σ24, σ28, σ32, σ38, σ54, and σ70.Availability: For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly and publicly accessible web-server for the powerful new predictor has been established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iPromoter-2L/. It is anticipated that iPromoter-2L will become a very useful high throughput tool for genome analysis.Contact:bliu@hit.edu.cn or dshuang@tongji.edu.cn or kcchou@gordonlifescience.orgSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

  abstract = {{With less than 2\% of the human genome coding for proteins, a major challenge is to interpret the function of the non-coding DNA. Millions of regulatory sequences have been predicted in the human genome through the analyses of DNA methylation, chromatin modification, hypersensitivity to nucleases, and transcription factor binding, but few have been shown to regulate transcription in their native contexts. We have developed a high throughput CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing strategy and used it to interrogate 174 candidate regulatory sequences within the 1Mbp POU5F1 locus in the human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We identified two classical regulatory elements - including a promoter and a proximal enhancer - that are essential for POU5F1 transcription in the hESCs. Unexpectedly, we also discovered a new class of enhancers that contribute to POU5F1 transcription in an unusual way: disruption of such sequences led to a temporary loss of POU5F1 transcription that is fully restored after a few rounds of cell division. These results demonstrate the utility of a high throughput screening for functional characterization of non-coding DNA, and reveal a previously unrecognized layer of gene regulation in human cells.}},

We apply this in large scale to the human lymphoblastoid cell lines from the Yoruban population, and detected nearly 75,000 eRNA transcription sites with high sensitivity and specificity. We identify genetic variants significantly associated with overall eRNA initiation levels, as well as the transcription directionality between the two divergent eRNA pairs, namely the transcription initiation and directional initiation quantitative trait loci (tiQTLs and diQTLs) respectively. High-resolution analyses of these two types of eRNA QTLs reveal distinct positions of enrichment not only at the central transcription factor (TF) binding regions but also at the flanking eRNA initiation regions, both of which are equivalently associated with mRNA expression QTLs. These two regions - the central TF binding footprint and the eRNA initiation cores - define the bipartite architecture and the function of enhancers, and may provide further insights into interpreting the significance of non-coding regulatory variants.</p>}},

Distinct GC sequence compositions and stabilizing 5′ splicing (U1) regulatory motif patterns may have predisposed P/E elements to regulatory repurposing, and changes in the U1 and polyadenylation signal densities and distributions likely drove the evolutionary activity switches.

We began with E2F1 binding site information obtained from ChIP-chip analyses of ENCODE regions, from both HeLa and MCF7 cells. Our approach not only distinguished targets from nontargets with a high specificity, but it also identified five regulatory modules for E2F1. One of the identified modules predicted a colocalization of E2F1 and AP-2alpha on a set of target promoters with an intersite distance of <270 bp. We tested this prediction using ChIP-chip assays with arrays containing approximately 14,000 human promoters. We found that both E2F1 and AP-2alpha bind within the predicted distance to a large number of human promoters, demonstrating the strength of our sequence-based, unbiased, and universal protocol.

  abstract = {{Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation is dependent on metabolic state, and implicates specific metabolic factors in neural functions that drive behaviour1. In neurons, acetylation of histones relies on the metabolite acetyl-CoA, which is produced from acetate by chromatin-bound acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2)2. Notably, the breakdown of alcohol in the liver leads to a rapid increase in levels of blood acetate3, and alcohol is therefore a major source of acetate in the body. Histone acetylation in neurons may thus be under the influence of acetate that is derived from alcohol4, with potential effects on alcohol-induced gene expression in the brain, and on behaviour5. Here, using in vivo stable-isotope labelling in mice, we show that the metabolism of alcohol contributes to rapid acetylation of histones in the brain, and that this occurs in part through the direct deposition of acetyl groups that are derived from alcohol onto histones in an ACSS2-dependent manner. A similar direct deposition was observed when mice were injected with heavy-labelled acetate in vivo. In a pregnant mouse, exposure to labelled alcohol resulted in the incorporation of labelled acetyl groups into gestating fetal brains. In isolated primary hippocampal neurons ex vivo, extracellular acetate induced transcriptional programs related to learning and memory, which were sensitive to ACSS2 inhibition. We show that alcohol-related associative learning requires ACSS2 in vivo. These findings suggest that there is a direct link between alcohol metabolism and gene regulation, through the ACSS2-dependent acetylation of histones in the brain. Acetate that is produced from the breakdown of alcohol contributes to histone acetylation in the brain, indicating that there is a direct link between alcohol metabolism and gene expression.}},

However, eQTLs tend to have significantly reduced effect sizes on protein levels, which suggests that their potential impact on downstream phenotypes is often attenuated or buffered.

  abstract = {{MOTIVATION:Enhancers are of short regulatory DNA elements. They can be bound with proteins (activators) to activate transcription of a gene, and hence play a critical role in promoting gene transcription in eukaryotes. With the avalanche of DNA sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is a challenging task to develop computational methods for timely identifying enhancers from extremely complicated DNA sequences. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, they were limited at only identifying whether a query DNA element being of an enhancer or not. According to the distinct levels of biological activities and regulatory effects on target genes, however, enhancers should be further classified into strong and weak ones in strength.

RESULTS:In view of this, a two-layer predictor called ' IENHANCER-2L: ' was proposed by formulating DNA elements with the 'pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition', into which the six DNA local parameters were incorporated. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first computational predictor ever established for identifying not only enhancers, but also their strength. Rigorous cross-validation tests have indicated that IENHANCER-2L: holds very high potential to become a useful tool for genome analysis.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a web server for the two-layer predictor was established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iEnhancer-2L/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.

We identified 4,570 SNPs across the PDE4D gene, with 380 associated to schizophrenia (p≤0.05). Importantly, two of these variants, rs35278 and rs165940, are located at transcription factor binding sites, and displayed replicable association in the two-stage enlargement of the familial schizophrenia cohort, (combined statistics for rs35278 p=0.0012; OR=1.18, 95\% CI 1.06-1.32; and rs165940 p=0.0016; OR=1.27, 95\% CI 1.13-1.41). Further analysis using additional cohorts and endophenotypes revealed that rs165940 principally associates within the psychosis (p=0.025, OR=1.18, 95\% CI 1.07-1.30) and cognitive domains of major mental illnesses. Specifically, the cognitive domain was a factor score for quantitative neuropsychological endophenotypes related to verbal learning and memory (p=0.0078, β=-0.19). Moreover, expression data from the GTEx database demonstrated that rs165940 significantly correlates with the mRNA expression levels of PDE4D in the cerebellum (p-value=0.04; post-prob=0.9; m-value=1.4), demonstrating a potential functional consequence for this variant. Thus, rs165940 represents the most likely functional variant for major mental illness at the PDE4D locus in the Finnish population, increasing risk broadly to psychotic disorders.

In this paper we used paired‐ and single‐end deep sequencing to analyze Arabidopsis TSS tags from several libraries prepared from roots, shoots, flowers and etiolated seedlings. The clustering of approximately 33 million mapped TSS tags led to the identification of 324 461 promoters that covered 79.7\% (21 672/27 206) of protein‐coding genes in the Arabidopsis genome. In addition we identified intragenic, antisense and orphan promoters that were not associated with any gene models. Of these, intragenic promoters exhibited unique characteristics regarding dinucleotide sequences at TSSs and core promoter element composition, suggesting that these promoters use different mechanisms of transcriptional initiation. An analysis of base composition with regard to promoter position revealed a low GC content throughout the promoter region and several local strand biases that were evident for TATA‐type promoters, but not for Coreless‐type promoters. Most observed strand biases coincided with strand biases of single nucleotide polymorphism rate. Our analysis also revealed that transcription of a gene is supported by an average of 2.7 genic promoters, among which one specific promoter, designated as a top promoter, substantially determines the expression level of the gene. All genes require a promoter, a region that determines the position, direction, frequency, and timing of transcription. Here we describe the use of transcription start site tags from various Arabidopsis tissues to identify promoters for approximately 80\% of annotated genes, as well as many intragenic, antisense, and Orphan promoters.}},

De novo annotation of nascent transcripts accurately mapped start sites and unstable transcripts. Examining the promoters of coding and noncoding transcripts identified comparable chromatin signatures, a conserved "TGT" core promoter motif and unreported transcription factor-binding sites. Mapping of engaged RNA polymerases showed a lack of enhancer RNAs, promoter-proximal pausing, and divergent transcription in Arabidopsis seedlings and maize, which are commonly present in yeast and humans. In contrast, Arabidopsis and maize genes accumulate RNA polymerases in proximity of the polyadenylation site, a trend that coincided with longer genes and CpG hypomethylation. Lack of promoter-proximal pausing and a higher correlation of nascent and steady-state transcripts indicate Arabidopsis may regulate transcription predominantly at the level of initiation.

Our analysis indicates that large fractions of duplicated gene pairs still share transcriptional characteristics. However, our results also indicate that expression divergence occurs frequently between duplicated gene pairs, a process which frequently might be employed for the retention of sequence redundant gene pairs. Preserved overall similarity between promoters of duplicated genes as well as preservation of individual cis-elements within the respective promoters indicates that the process of transcriptional neo- and subfunctionalization is restricted to only a fraction of cis-elements. We show that sequence similarities and shared regulatory properties within duplicated promoters provide a powerful means to undertake large-scale cis-regulatory element identification by applying an intragenomic phylogenetic footprinting approach.

Theoretical reasoning and empirical data both suggest that the fatal effect of inactivating an essential gene can be attributed to either the loss of indispensable core cellular function (Type I), or the gain of fatal side effects after losing dispensable periphery function (Type II). In principle, inactivation of Type I essential genes can be rescued only by re-gain of the core functions, whereas inactivation of Type II essential genes could be rescued by a further loss of function of another gene to eliminate the otherwise fatal side effects. Because such loss-of-function rescuing mutations may occur spontaneously, Type II essential genes may become nonessential in a few individuals of a large population. Motivated by this reasoning, we here carried out a systematic screening for Type II essentiality in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Large-scale whole-genome sequencing of essentiality-reversing mutants reveals 14 cases whereby the inactivation of an essential gene is rescued by loss-of-function mutations on another gene. In particular, the essential gene encoding the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) is shown to be Type II, suggesting a loss-of-function therapeutic strategy for the human disorder ADSL deficiency.

Furthermore, they coincide with house-keeping gene promoters and the associated genes are stably expressed across multiple cell types. Despite these features, HOT regions are solemnly defined using ChIP-seq experiments and shown to lack canonical motifs for transcription factors that are thought to be bound there. Although, ChIP-seq experiments are the golden standard for finding genome-wide binding sites of a protein, they are not noise free. Here, we show that HOT regions are likely to be ChIP-seq artifacts and they are similar to previously proposed “hyper-ChIPable” regions. Using ChIP-seq data sets for knocked-out transcription factors, we demonstrate presence of false positive signals on HOT regions. We observe sequence characteristics and genomic features that are discriminatory of HOT regions, such as GC/CpG-rich k-mers and enrichment of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) and DNA tertiary structures (G-quadruplex DNA). The artificial ChIP-seq enrichment on HOT regions could be associated to these discriminatory features.

RESULTS:We present DREME, a motif discovery algorithm specifically designed to find the short, core DNA-binding motifs of eukaryotic TFs, and optimized to analyze very large ChIP-seq datasets in minutes. Using DREME, we discover the binding motifs of the the ChIP-ed TF and many cofactors in mouse ES cell (mESC), mouse erythrocyte and human cell line ChIP-seq datasets. For example, in mESC ChIP-seq data for the TF Esrrb, we discover the binding motifs for eight cofactor TFs important in the maintenance of pluripotency. Several other commonly used algorithms find at most two cofactor motifs in this same dataset. DREME can also perform discriminative motif discovery, and we use this feature to provide evidence that Sox2 and Oct4 do not bind in mES cells as an obligate heterodimer. DREME is much faster than many commonly used algorithms, scales linearly in dataset size, finds multiple, non-redundant motifs and reports a reliable measure of statistical significance for each motif found. DREME is available as part of the MEME Suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools (http://meme.nbcr.net).}},

As a result many methods of analyzing genetic data assume that samples are a random draw from a well-mixed population, but are applied to clustered samples from populations that are structured clinally over space. Here we use simulations of populations living in continuous geography to study the impacts of dispersal and sampling strategy on population genetic summary statistics, demographic inference, and genome-wide association studies. We find that most common summary statistics have distributions that differ substantially from that seen in well-mixed populations, especially when Wright9s neighborhood size is less than 100 and sampling is spatially clustered. The combination of low dispersal and clustered sampling causes demographic inference from the site frequency spectrum to infer more turbulent demographic histories, but averaged results across multiple simulations were surprisingly robust to isolation by distance. We also show that the combination of spatially autocorrelated environments and limited dispersal causes genome-wide association studies to identify spurious signals of genetic association with purely environmentally determined phenotypes, and that this bias is only partially corrected by regressing out principal components of ancestry. Last, we discuss the relevance of our simulation results for inference from genetic variation in real organisms.</p>}},

When applied to breast cancer tumor samples, our methods readily detect the known allele-specific effects of copy number variation and nonsense mediated decay. Further, genes that are found to recurrently exhibit differential ASE across samples are cancer relevant. Genes with cis mutations are enriched for differential ASE, and we find 147 potentially functional noncoding mutations cis to genes that exhibit significant differential ASE.

Recent studies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional genomic regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful epistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles. However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that Neanderthals had at least 40\% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5\%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious alleles that arose recently in the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms retain gene flow from other species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from introgression.}},

Comparative studies of the methylome across a diverse range of non-conventional and conventional model organisms is expected to help reveal how the landscape of DNA methylation and its functions have evolved. Here we explore the DNA methylation profile of two species of the crustacean Daphnia using whole genome bisulfite sequencing. We then compare our data with the methylomes of two insects and two mammals to achieve a better understanding of the function of DNA methylation in Daphnia. Using RNA-sequencing data for all six species, we investigate the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression. DNA methylation in Daphnia is mainly enriched within the coding regions of genes, with the highest methylation levels observed at exons 2-4. In contrast, vertebrate genomes are globally methylated, and increase towards the highest methylation levels observed at exon 2, and maintained across the rest of the gene body. Although DNA methylation patterns differ among all species, their methylation profiles share a bimodal distribution across the genomes. Genes with low levels of CpG methylation and gene expression are mainly enriched for species specific genes. In contrast, genes associated with high methylated CpG sites are highly transcribed and evolutionary conserved across all species. Finally, the positive correlation between internal exons and gene expression potentially points to an evolutionary conserved mechanism, whereas the negative regulation of gene expression via methylation of promoters and exon 1 is potentially a secondary mechanism that has been evolved in vertebrates.}},

I can closely paraphrase what he said: "We called this meeting to discuss with you, as Chairman of the Department, a fundamental problem with our systems science curriculum. In general, we consider it a good curriculum: we learn a lot of concepts, principles, and methodological tools, mathematical, computational, heuristic, which are fundamental to understanding and dealing with systems. And, yet, we learn virtually nothing about systems science itself. What is systems science? What are its historical roots? What are its aims? Where does it stand and where is it likely to go? These are pressing questions to us. After all, aren't we supposed to carry the systems science flag after we graduate from this program? We feel that a broad introductory course to systems science is urgently needed in the curriculum. Do you agree with this assessment?" The answer was obvious and, yet, not easy to give: "I agree, of course, but I do not see how the situation could be alleviated in the foreseeable future.}},

For most traits, tissue-shared eQTLs underlie a greater proportion of trait associations, although tissue-specific eQTLs have a greater contribution to some traits, such as blood pressure. By integrating information from biological pathways with eQTL target genes and applying a gene-based approach, we validate previously implicated causal genes and pathways, and propose new variant and gene associations for several complex traits, which we replicate in the UK BioBank and BioVU.

To understand how an organism's genome specifies its form and function, it is therefore necessary to understand how patterns of gene expression are encoded in DNA. Decades of analysis of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have identified numerous regulatory sequences, but have not fully illuminated how they work. Here we harness the record of natural selection to probe the function of these sequences. We identified regulatory sequences from scavenger fly species that diverged from Drosophila over 100 million years ago. While these regulatory sequences are almost completely different from their Drosophila counterparts, they drive identical expression patterns in Drosophila embryos, demonstrating extreme flexibility in the molecular machines that interpret regulatory DNA. Yet, the identical outputs produced by these sequences mean they must have something in common, and we describe one shared feature of regulatory sequence organization and function that has emerged from these comparisons. Our approach can be generalized to any regulatory system and species, and we believe that a growing collection of regulatory sequences with dissimilar sequences but similar outputs will reveal the molecular logic of gene regulation.}},

Until recently, little has been reported about the determinants of human cell identity, particularly from the joint perspective of gene evolution and expression. Here, we chart the evolutionary past of all documented human cell types via the collective histories of proteins, the principal product of gene expression. FANTOM5 data provide cell-type-specific digital expression of human protein-coding genes and the SUPERFAMILY resource is used to provide protein domain annotation. The evolutionary epoch in which each protein was created is inferred by comparison with domain annotation of all other completely sequenced genomes. Studying the distribution across epochs of genes expressed in each cell type reveals insights into human cellular evolution in terms of protein innovation. For each cell type, its history of protein innovation is charted based on the genes it expresses. Combining the histories of all cell types enables us to create a timeline of cell evolution. This timeline identifies the possibility that our common ancestor Coelomata (cavity-forming animals) provided the innovation required for the innate immune system, whereas cells which now form the brain of human have followed a trajectory of continually accumulating novel proteins since Opisthokonta (boundary of animals and fungi). We conclude that exaptation of existing domain architectures into new contexts is the dominant source of cell-type-specific domain architectures.}},

  abstract = {{RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription elongation is a highly regulated process that greatly influences mRNA levels as well as pre-mRNA splicing. Despite many studies in vitro, how chromatin modulates RNAPII elongation in vivo is still unclear. Here, we show that a decrease in the level of available canonical histones leads to more accessible chromatin with decreased levels of canonical histones and variants H2A.X and H2A.Z and increased levels of H3.3. With this altered chromatin structure, the RNAPII elongation rate increases, and the kinetics of pre-mRNA splicing is delayed with respect to RNAPII elongation. Consistent with the kinetic model of cotranscriptional splicing, the rapid RNAPII elongation induced by histone depletion promotes the skipping of variable exons in the CD44 gene. Indeed, a slowly elongating mutant of RNAPII was able to rescue this defect, indicating that the defective splicing induced by histone depletion is a direct consequence of the increased elongation rate. In addition, genome-wide analysis evidenced that histone reduction promotes widespread alterations in pre-mRNA processing, including intron retention and changes in alternative splicing. Our data demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing may be regulated by chromatin structure through the modulation of the RNAPII elongation rate.}},

Identification of cis-regulatory elements responsible for cell-type specific gene expression is essential for understanding the origin of the cellular diversity. Conventional assays to map cis-elements via open chromatin analysis of primary tissues fail to resolve their cell type specificity and lack the sensitivity to identify cis-elements in rare cell types. Single nucleus analysis of transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) can overcome this limitation, but current analysis methods begin with pre-defined genomic regions of accessibility and are therefore biased toward the dominant population of a tissue. Here we report a method, Single Nucleus Analysis Pipeline for ATAC-seq (SnapATAC), that can efficiently dissect cellular heterogeneity in an unbiased manner using single nucleus ATAC-seq datasets and identify candidate regulatory sequences in constituent cell types. We demonstrate that SnapATAC outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and scalability. We further analyze 64,795 single cell chromatin profiles from the secondary motor cortex of mouse brain, creating a chromatin landscape atlas with unprecedent resolution, including over 300,000 candidate cis-regulatory elements in nearly 50 distinct cell populations.

  abstract = {{Objective Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease characterized by pancreatic islet dysfunction, insulin resistance, and disruption of blood-glucose levels. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >400 independent signals that encode genetic predisposition. More than 90\% of the associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) localize to non-coding regions and are enriched in chromatin-defined islet enhancer elements, indicating a strong regulatory component to disease susceptibility. Pancreatic islets are a mixture of cell types expressing distinct hormonal programs, and so each cell type may contribute differentially to the underlying regulatory processes that modulate T2D-associated transcriptional circuits. Existing chromatin profiling methods such as ATAC-seq and DNase-seq, applied to islets in bulk, produce aggregate profiles that mask important cellular and regulatory heterogeneity. Methods We present genome-wide single cell chromatin accessibility profiles in >1,600 cells derived from a human pancreatic islet sample using single-cell-combinatorial-indexing ATAC-seq (sci-ATAC-seq). We also developed a deep learning model based on the U-Net architecture to accurately predict open chromatin peak calls in rare cell populations. Results We show that sci-ATAC-seq profiles allow us to deconvolve alpha, beta, and delta cell populations and identify cell-type-specific regulatory signatures underlying T2D. Particularly, we find that T2D GWAS SNPs are significantly enriched in beta cell-specific and cross cell-type shared islet open chromatin, but not in alpha or delta cell-specific open chromatin. We also demonstrate, using less abundant delta cells, that deep-learning models can improve signal recovery and feature reconstruction of rarer cell-populations. Finally, we use co-accessibility measures to nominate the cell-specific target genes at 104 non-coding T2D GWAS signals. Conclusions Collectively, we identify the islet cell-type of action across genetic signals of T2D predisposition and provide higher-resolution mechanistic insights into genetically encoded risk pathways. * (ATAC-seq) : Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin Sequencing (GWAS) : Genome wide association study (eQTL) : Expression quantitative trait loci (GCG) : Glucagon (INS) : Insulin (SST) : Somatostatin.}},

We observed that evolutionary gain of new internal exons is associated with gain of new transcription start sites (TSS) nearby and increased gene expression. Inhibiting exon splicing reduced transcription from nearby promoters. Conversely, creation of new splice sites, enabling splicing of new exons, activated transcription from cryptic promoters. The strongest effects were associated with weak promoters located proximal and upstream of efficiently spliced exons. Together, our findings support a model in which splicing recruits transcription machinery locally to influence TSS choice, and identify exon gain, loss and regulatory change as major contributors to the evolution of alternative promoters and altered gene expression in mammals. * RNAPII : RNA polymerase II GTF : general transcription factor CTD : carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII snRNP : small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles PCPA : premature cleavage and polyadenylation site TSS : transcription start site EMATS : Exon-Mediated Activation of Transcription Starts PSI : percent spliced in Start-seq : high-resolution sequencing of polymerase-associated RNA H3K4me3 : histone 3 lysine 4 trimethyl Kb : kilobases MO : morpholino antisense oligonucleotides SE : skipped exon CE : constitutive exon}},

  doi = {10.1101/810127}, 
  abstract = {{Background The majority of eukaryotic promoters utilize multiple transcription start sites (TSSs). How multiple TSSs are specified at individual promoters across eukaryotes is not understood for most species. In S. cerevisiae , a preinitiation complex comprised of Pol II and conserved general transcription factors (GTFs) assembles and opens DNA upstream of TSSs. Evidence from model promoters indicates that the PIC scans from upstream to downstream to identify TSSs. Prior results suggest that TSS distributions at promoters where scanning occurs shift in a polar fashion upon alteration in Pol II catalytic activity or GTF function. Results To determine extent of promoter scanning across promoter classes in S. cerevisiae , we perturbed Pol II catalytic activity and GTF function and analyzed their effects on TSS usage genome-wide. We find that alterations to Pol II, TFIIB, or TFIIF function widely alter the initiation landscape consistent with promoter scanning operating at all yeast promoters, regardless of promoter class. Promoter architecture, however, can determine extent of promoter sensitivity to altered Pol II activity in ways that are predicted by a scanning model. Conclusions Our observations coupled with previous data validate this scanning model for Pol II initiation in yeast – which we term the “shooting gallery”. In this model, Pol II catalytic activity, and the rate and processivity of Pol II scanning together with promoter sequence determine the distribution of TSSs and their usage. Comparison of TSS distributions and their relationship to promoter sequence among other eukaryotes suggest some, but not all, share characteristics of S. cerevisiae .}},

  abstract = {{The observations that introns are acquired in bursts and that exons are often nucleosome-sized can be explained by the generation of introns from DNA transposons, which insert between nucleosomes. In eukaryotes, genes are often interrupted by non-coding sequences, or introns, that must be removed to permit the function of the gene. Evolutionary analysis suggests that introns are acquired in bursts, but the mechanism underlying this punctuated acquisition is unknown. A new analysis by Scott Roy and colleagues offers insight into how DNA transposons can serve as the source of intron sequences. Their data shows that transposons insert between nucleosomes, which explains previous observations about exon size. The discovery of introns four decades ago was one of the most unexpected findings in molecular biology1. Introns are sequences interrupting genes that must be removed as part of messenger RNA production. Genome sequencing projects have shown that most eukaryotic genes contain at least one intron, and frequently many2,3. Comparison of these genomes reveals a history of long evolutionary periods during which few introns were gained, punctuated by episodes of rapid, extensive gain2,3. However, although several detailed mechanisms for such episodic intron generation have been proposed4,5,6,7,8, none has been empirically supported on a genomic scale. Here we show how short, non-autonomous DNA transposons independently generated hundreds to thousands of introns in the prasinophyte Micromonas pusilla and the pelagophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens. Each transposon carries one splice site. The other splice site is co-opted from the gene sequence that is duplicated upon transposon insertion, allowing perfect splicing out of the RNA. The distributions of sequences that can be co-opted are biased with respect to codons, and phasing of transposon-generated introns is similarly biased. These transposons insert between pre-existing nucleosomes, so that multiple nearby insertions generate nucleosome-sized intervening segments. Thus, transposon insertion and sequence co-option may explain the intron phase biases2 and prevalence of nucleosome-sized exons9 observed in eukaryotes. Overall, the two independent examples of proliferating elements illustrate a general DNA transposon mechanism that can plausibly account for episodes of rapid, extensive intron gain during eukaryotic evolution2,3.}},

Here, we have applied the PAT-Seq approach to systematically isolate, sequence, and map tissue specific mRNA from five highly studied <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> somatic tissues: GABAergic and NMDA neurons, arcade and intestinal valve cells, seam cells and hypodermal tissues, and studied their mRNA expression dynamics. The integration of these datasets with previously profiled transcriptomes of intestine, pharynx, and body muscle tissues, precisely assigns tissue specific expression dynamics for 60\% of all annotated <i>C. elegans</i> protein-coding genes, providing an important resource for the scientific community. The mapping of 15,956 unique high-quality tissue specific polyA sites in all eight somatic tissues reveals extensive tissue specific 39UTR isoform switching through alternative polyadenylation (APA). Almost all ubiquitously transcribed genes use APA and harbor miRNA targets in their 39UTRs, which are commonly lost in a tissue specific manner, suggesting widespread usage of post-transcriptional gene regulation modulated through APA to fine tune tissue specific protein expression. Within this pool, the human disease gene <i>C. elegans</i> orthologs <i>rack-1</i> and <i>tct-1</i> use APA to switch to shorter 39UTR isoforms in order to evade miRNA regulation in the body muscle tissue, resulting in increased protein expression needed for proper body muscle function. Our results highlight a major positive regulatory role for APA, allowing genes to counteract miRNA regulation on a tissue specific basis.</p>}},

However, its impact on the genome-wide transcription initiation landscape remains elusive. By conducting a genome-wide analysis of transcription start sites (TSSs) using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) sequencing, we show that thousands of TSSs are exclusively activated in various epigenetic mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana and referred to as cryptic TSSs. Many have not been identified in previous studies, of which up to 65\% are contributed by transposons. They possess similar genetic features to regular TSSs and their activation is strongly associated with the ectopic recruitment of RNAPII machinery. The activation of cryptic TSSs significantly alters transcription of nearby TSSs, including those of genes important for development and stress responses. Our study, therefore, sheds light on the role of epigenetic regulation in maintaining proper gene functions in plants by suppressing transcription from cryptic TSSs.}},

In recent years, we have advanced in the discovery and phylogenetic placement of new eukaryotic species and lineages, which in turn completely transformed our view on the eukaryotic tree of life.

Here, we discuss how high-throughput genome-wide gene expression analysis of eukaryotic single cells can shed light on protist biology. First, we review different single-cell transcriptomics methodologies with particular focus on microbial eukaryote applications. Then, we discuss single-cell gene expression analysis of protists in culture and what can be learnt from these approaches. Finally, we envision the application of single-cell transcriptomics to protist communities to interrogate not only community components, but also the gene expression signatures of distinct cellular and physiological states, as well as the transcriptional dynamics of interspecific interactions. Overall, we argue that single-cell transcriptomics can significantly contribute to our understanding of the biology of microbial eukaryotes.

  abstract = {{MOTIVATION:The position-weight matrix (PWM) is a useful representation of a transcription factor binding site (TFBS) sequence pattern because the PWM can be estimated from a small number of representative TFBS sequences. However, because the PWM probability model assumes independence between individual nucleotide positions, the PWMs for some TFs poorly discriminate binding sites from non-binding-sites that have similar sequence content. Since the local three-dimensional DNA structure ('shape') is a determinant of TF binding specificity and since DNA shape has a significant sequence-dependence, we combined DNA shape-derived features into a TF-generalized regulatory score and tested whether the score could improve PWM-based discrimination of TFBS from non-binding-sites.

RESULTS:We compared a traditional PWM model to a model that combines the PWM with a DNA shape feature-based regulatory potential score, for accuracy in detecting binding sites for 75 vertebrate transcription factors. The PWM + shape model was more accurate than the PWM-only model, for 45\% of TFs tested, with no significant loss of accuracy for the remaining TFs.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:The shape-based model is available as an open-source R package at that is archived on the GitHub software repository at https://github.com/ramseylab/regshape/.
