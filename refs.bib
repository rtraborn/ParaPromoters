annote = {Shugoshin = a protein phosphatase 2A protein complex. 

SGO = protects centromeri cohesin during mitotic prophase in animal cells, and more generally during Meiosis I

There are two SGOs in S. pombe --{\&}gt; SGO1 and SGO2

Together they interact with Aurora B and PP2A to promote KT-MT attachment and centromeric cohesion, respectively. 

Once all sisters achieve biorientation, the APC dependent degradation of securin liberates separase.

Separase cleaves the cohesin subunit Rad21. 

SAC == perceives the unattached kinetochores; a lack of tension, and prevents premature entry to anaphase by inhibiting the APC.

Aurora B = destabilizes erroneous attachments, activates APC

SGO = loads the Aurora B complex to centromeres and ensures the bipolar attachment of kitetochores.

Bub1 is a conserved SAC protein kinase and a tumor suppressor.

SGO's centromeric localization is Bub1-dependent.

Challenge: Bub1 substrates are not known.

Assay: chromatin fraction incubated with radiolabeled ATP +/- Bub1.

Found Histone H2A-Ser-121 was phospohrylated by Bub1, but NOT by Aurora B.

They prove that it's Serine-121 by doing a phospho-amino acid analysis. 

Performed the necessary in vitro experiment to show this direct phosphorylation.

Made kinase-dead point mutation allele of bub1 --{\&}gt; bub1-KD, and examined H2A-Ser-121 phosphorylation --{\&}gt; completely abolished.

Figure 2: bub1-KD, h2a-SA mutants both exhibit similar chromosomal instability defects.

This includes non-disjunction at MII , equational segregation at MI

Figure 3- Cool experiment : physically link SGO2 to H3 using a CD-- this suppresses the phenotype.

Him-19's role

- no recruitment of ZIPM-3 
- no pairing initiation (all chromosomes)
- loss of clustering at TZ
- loss of synapsis

Zim-3 foci happen in a HIM-10 mutant only after irraditiona. This suggests that DSBs are required for ZIM-3 foci, and these don't happen in a HIM-19
